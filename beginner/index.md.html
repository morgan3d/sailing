Sailing is an ecologically friendly way to enjoy nature, stay fit,
make friends, and have fun. The activity is available to everyone near
an appropriate body of water, across age, gender, economic means, and
physical ability.

Sailing can mean fooling around in bathing suits and boats only
slightly larger than surfboards at a lake on a warm afternoon.  Or it
might mean day sailing a wide river with snacks in hand and
appreciative guests.

Once you're comfortable with small boats, you might choose to build up
to larger ones. That could mean weeks spent cruising in fantasy
destinations on a boat with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms, a
kitchen, and living room.

There's also a competitive sport of sailing. Racing varies from
chasing neighbors around on a Wednesday night to international
competition and setting ocean speed records.

Minimum Ability
===================================================

I've helped hundreds of people learn to sail in person. This article
describes a process that I saw work well for many people. As written,
it applicable as written for anyone:

- with access to a safely navigable body of water for a novice (mild temperature, gentle wind, low currents, small waves, low boat traffic),
- who is able to swim or at least dog paddle with a life jacket on, and
- who can perform the equivalent of pulling themselves out of a pool without a ladder.

That's all of the physical capability needed for starting sailing
by yourself. (If you don't have that ability, keep reading in the next section.
Don't give up here.)

You need these abilities for safety. What you don't need to start is
the strength to pull hard on ropes, to balance well, be able to 
climb a mast, or generally jump around.

Experienced sailing can be very physically demanding if you choose. But when
beginning, sailing is the rare sport where you do not have to be
particularly athletic. After all, we're talking about a sport where you spend
most of your time as a beginner sitting down, can rest any time, and
might end up eating lunch while doing the activity!


Sailing with Physical Limitations
==============================================================

Good news for those without the abilities I described above.
You can still learn to sail if you are unable to swim or reliably pull
yourself out of the water. That might be due to aerobic or cardiac condition, upper
body strength, body shape, an injury, or a disability.

Courses with an instructor and safety partner can be particularly
valuable in this case. They will help you get in and out of the boat
on land, and stay with you in or next to the boat on the water.

There are specific "para
sailing" or "able sailing" boats designed for people with disabilities. These boats
are
either self-righting or almost impossible to capsize, and have
accomodation to not require multiple limbs. They include the
[RS Venture](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-venture-connect-scs/),
[Martin 16](https://martin16.com/), and the
competitive [2.4mR](https://www.inter24metre.org/).

Canada has a nation-wide
[para sailing education program](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-para/)
and [able sailing network](https://ablesailnetwork.com/).

In the US, see the [US Sailing Adaptive Sailing](https://www.ussailing.org/education/adult/adaptive-sailing/) program,
and search for one of the many adaptive sailing programs at a club near you.

Internationally, [International Association for Disabled Sailing](https://www.sailing.org/new-to-sailing/disabled-sailing)
and [Blind Sailing](https://www.blindsailinginternational.com/) support disabled sailers, as well
as various regional and national organizations.


Start with a Dinghy
==============================================

Regardless of what your sailing end goal is, how fit you are, or how
old you are, the absolute best way to learn is to start with a
single-person small boat, a "dinghy". Every sailing instructor or
world-class expert will tell you this.

I believe that for many people, the key to learning sailing both
quickly and deeply is to not only start with a small boat. It is also
figure things out for yourself. I recommend that you do not _begin_ by
taking a course if there are no outstanding safety concerns or access
limitations to boats.

That also means don't have a friend give you detailed instructions and
feedback (but do welcome them to sail alongside you in their own
boat!) Definitely do not let a parent or spouse instruct you, or learn
with you, until you have the basics locked in. If a couple or siblings
get into a boat together, it is almost guaranteed that only one of
them is going to learn.

Those other sources of information such as courses and friends are
great once you have the basics. When you first start, I strongly
believe that formal lessons and specific advice just confuse and slow
you down.

How can you figure it out for yourself? Well, making mistakes in a
small boat has little penalty and is often fun. A small boat lets you
directly feel all of the forces at work and experiment with them. The
systems are simple, so you can focus on the most important
controls. If you approach it reasonably, the worst thing that will
happen is that you'll get wet. Which is actually pretty good thing if
it is a hot summer day. 

As with any aquatic activity, we must always respect the potential
danger of water, wear our floation devices, and stay aware of our
surroundings. By adhering to those practices, any place where it is
safe for you to swim is likely a good location to figure things out on
your own with a boat.


The First Time: 10 Steps
=====================================================================

Learning to sail is a simple process. Get a boat, learn to recover
from a capsize, and then figure everything else out on the water
yourself through experimentation. Spelled out in ten steps for your
first day:

1. **Get a boat** and everything from the Equipment and Conditions section. Probably
   not by buying one, although that's an option if you're committed.
   Bring a friend to watch you, lifeguard style, from shore or another
   boat.
3. **Launch your boat** by walking it from the beach into
   shoulder-deep water _without getting in the boat_. If you don't 
   have a beach, ride the
   boat away from a dock with a big shove off, _and then jump in the
   water_ when it is about shoulder deep. Let go of any concern about getting wet or falling in while sailing, since
   you are already in the water. Aren't you glad that you got that out of the way early?
4. **Capsize the boat** by tipping it over 90 degrees so that the sail is in the water,
   but the boat isn't yet upside down. Do this while you are still in an area where you can easily
   stand with your head above water. For example, grab the mast from the water
   and pull it towards you. Be careful to not hit yourself with the mast or boom or 
   end up under the sail as you do this.
5. **Swim around the front or back of the boat to what is normally the "bottom"**. The bottom of the boat is now vertical like a wall.
   You should end up holding onto the big fin called the "centerboard" or "daggerboard" that is 
   now sticking out sideways. You're wearing a PFD, so this is more like dog paddling or treading water than
   real swimming. Stay in contact with the boat the whole time if you can. 
6. **Recover the boat** by hanging on the centerboard from the
   water. You don't need to pull yourself up. Just pull the boat
   down towards you. It will naturally slide sideways as it comes upright and not hit you.
7. **Board** by swimming to the back and climbing/clamboring/sliding in. Keep a hand on the boat as you go 
   around to the back so that it doesn't drift away. As you climb in, try not to
   pull on the "tiller" (the stick connected to the fin at the back) as a handle.
   That is the only potentially fragile part of the boat. Don't try to
   reboard at the side of the boat your first time. It is harder to get in
   on the side.
8. Now, go sailing! **Adjust the sail** by pulling on the rope attached to the "boom" (horizontal pole)
   until it stops flapping, and then let it back out a little until it is just
   about to flap around again. This is how you adjust the sail as you move around. 
   When in doubt, let it out.
9. **Let go of the rope** whenever you want to slow down or stop. The boat only moves
   because you are holding that rope in tight. It might make a lot of noise as the sail
   flaps, but you can stop any time you want to simply by letting go.
9. **Keep your head low** so that when the boom swings around it passes over you.
   You'll figure out when the boom is going to move later. For now, assume it is always
   ready to swing and you can't go wrong.
10. *Avoid things you don't want to hit.*
   That includes land, rocks, shallow water, other boats, animals, and swimmers.
   Give them at least 10 meters of room, and the more the better.

![A detailed video of capsize recovery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0flyv_GPwwc)

That's it! You'll figure out everything else yourself by trial and
error. You already know how to stop moving and how to handle the normal failure mode of
the boat tipping over. Stay close enough to land that you can swim back
to shore if you really need to.

If you are physically capable of climbing into the boat but aren't
willing to begin your sailing experience by first jumping into the
water, then give up now and go find another activity.  Seriously. You
can't learn to sail without getting wet at some point.  It is a
terrible idea to go out alone in a small boat that you haven't already
practiced recovering from a capsize. 


The Second Sail
=======================================================================

For the second time that you go sailing, I'm still not going to tell
you how to succeed at operating the boat. However, here are some tips
for how to move your body that may make you more comfortable. Don't
read this until you've done the first trip. It will make more sense
after that.

Sit on the side of the boat, not the center or back. Face the sail and
turn your head to look forward. Sit as far forward as you can be
without being in front of the mainsheet (rope from the sail)
attachment. 

As it gets windier, move your weight further out of the boat sideways,
hooking your feet under the strap if you need it for balance. The
further out and forward that you sit the more room you will have to
move your arms and stay away from the boom.

Hold the mainsheet and tiller (what you steer with) in front of your
chest, with your thumbs pointed in and up. Never let go of either. 

When you need to pull in a lot of mainsheet line, bring it from your
forward hand to your back hand (which is still holding the tiller),
pinch the line under your thumb, and then reach down with your forward
hand to grab more. When you need to ease the mainsheet out, let it run
slowly through your hand.

When you change which side of the wind the boat is on (tacking and gybing),
stay on the side of the boat. Duck and wait until the sail moves over your head. Then, switch sides
while facing forward, _without releasing the mainsheet or
tiller_. Your tiller hand will end up behind your back in your forward
hand and your mainsheet will be in your further aft hand in front of
you. When you are settled in on the new side, switch hands behind your
back. If you are tangled up trying to switch that means that you
turned the wrong way and faced backwards when you crossed the boat.

Avoid the temptation to slouch. Sit with
classic good chair posture.  Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and
head balanced over your shoulders. When you are leaning out to balance
the boat, keep your shoulders back and avoid letting the mainsheet and
tiller pull them forward. This will avoid an aching neck and lower
back afterwards.


The Next Few Times
=======================================================================

Once you've done the intentional capsize and recovery for your first
two sailing trips, you can skip those steps in the future. Just launch
by getting into the boat and shoving off. You'll be getting plenty of
capsize recovery experience on the water naturally.

I've noticed that novice sailors often launch from the dock,
presumably to avoid getting wet or because they associate boats with
docks. Experienced dinghy sailors usually launch from a beach when
they have the option. They know that getting wet is normal and that
launching is easier, safer, and less crowded on a beach. If you have a
choice of launching from a beach, do so. You only need to be
waist-deep normally when doing this. Shoulder-deep was just for your
first time capsize recovery.

The first time that the boat naturally capsizes while sailing you may
feel flustered, but you already know how to recover it.  After your
first few recoveries from unexpected capsizes, you'll be confident
that you don't need to worry about falling in the water or the boat
tipping over. And on a hot day, you'll begin to consider this part of
the fun.

After going out by yourself ten times, you'll be able to steer your
boat around and get back to shore confidently. You will also have
plenty of questions at that point, and be ready to understand the
answers to them. 

At that point you are ready for more research and formal learning.
This is the time to explore online guides and videos, books, sailing
courses, and the advice that friends and family are so eager to share.


Equipment and Conditions
================================================================

What you need:

- A *PFD* (personal floation device..."life jacket"), which you'll wear
  at all times when anywhere near the water, even on shore.
- An old **single-handed catboat dinghy**, such as a Laser, Sunfish, or 
  if you are very small, an Optimist. The boat should be sufficiently
  well-used so that you don't worry about damaging it a little.
- *8-16 kph* (5-10 mph, 4-8 kts) of wind.
- A *bailer*, if your boat has a deep cockpit. Boats with shallow
  or self-draining cockpits such as a Laser, Sunfish, or RS Zest don't 
  need this. A bailer is just a plastic jug with the top screwed on
  and the bottom cut off, so that you can scoop water out of the boat.
  Tie it onto the mast so that you don't lose it.
- A *hat*, and waterproof *sunscreen* or complete *UV blocking clothing*
  coverage, depending on the season.
- A wetsuit or *swim suit*, depending on the season. Do not wear
  street clothes, which will be heavy and cold when wet. Wear swimming clothes.
- A plastic or metal bottle of *drinking water*. This will float, but if
  you tie it to the mast then you won't have to worry about losing it
  in a capsize.
- A *safety whistle*, tied to your PFD and tucked in where it can't catch on
  anything. 
- A *friend* to sail a separate boat near you, or to watch you from the
  shore as a lifeguard, if you are in a location without a lot of
  other people around. This person is only there for true emergencies,
  such as if you are struck by another boat. They shouldn't help if
  your boat capsizes normally and you're able to recover, or if you
  are simply confused and drifting in an unfortunate
  direction. Mistakes that do not threaten injury are your own problem
  and part of the learning process.
- *Humility*. Look, you're going to make a fool out of yourself the
  first few times. You'll smack your shins, drift backwards
  confusedly, fall in the water, and put some cosmetic scratches on
  the boat. We all did! In a few months you'll be zipping around
  proudly. Set your expectations low and have a good time in the
  beginning.

You might want a small paddle or be required to have one by law. In
practice, you can paddle with your hands or jump in the water and pull
the boat if you need to. You're be out in light conditions in a tiny
boat.

You do _not_ need sailing boots, sailing gloves, a radio, anchor,
flares, life buoy, a trailer, binoculars, a large boat, a motor, or
any sort of license to start with a dinghy.

You do _not_ need to know how to tie knots, what the parts of the boat
are called, which sides are starboard and port, the navigation rules,
storm techniques, racing rules, or anything else. (You don't need to
know navigation rules because you're staying far away from all other
boats at first.)

You don't even need to know how to swim well, since you are wearing your
PFD at all times.

Like a bicycle, learning to sail when moving too slowly is actually
harder than when going a little faster. If there's less than 8 kph of
wind, hold out for a better day. If there's more than 20 kph, then it
will be obvious to you that you aren't ready for that.

Rain and light fog are fine for sailing. Cloudy days are ideal: it's easier
to see, powerboats and waterskiiers stay at home, and you're less likely
to experience sunburn. 

Do not
sail if there's any chance of a thunderstorm. You are going to be
sitting next to a giant metal pole that is the highest point around,
surrounded by water. 

Don't sail a small boat in water that is unsafe to swim in. For example,
due to dangers from to
pollution, current, temperature, breaking waves, rip currents, dangerous wildlife
(such as jellyfish, stingrays, or sharks), or underwater hazards.


Canadian Regulations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my understanding, in Canada, all small sailboats are
[required](https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp_511e.pdf)
to have on board:

- A PFD. Be smart. Wear it.
- A sound signalling device--that's your whistle.
- A manual propulsion mechanism, such as but not explicitly a paddle. _I
  consider my rudder and my hands to satisfy this requirement
  for a small sailboat. I know many people who strap a small emergency
  paddle to their mast or boom as well._
- A bailer, _which is "not required for a boat that cannot
  hold enough water to make it capsize or a boat that has watertight
  compartments that are sealed and not readily accessible",
  such as a Laser or RS Zest._
- 15 meters (50') of line for heaving and towing. _Your mainsheet tied
  to your halyard or painter is probably long enough. Most small boats
  have 12m of halyard and 13m of mainsheet_.

Boats engaged in a class or formal racing in good conditions that are
also accompanied by a safety boat (which can be the committee boat)
are exempted from these rules. Regardless, you should always wear your
PFD and carry a whistle, and if your boat needs it, carry a bailer. It
is only the tow line and paddle requirement that make sense to be
exempted from when in a fleet.


How to Get a Boat
=====================================================================
To get the boat you can borrow one from a friend, rent at
a tourist sailing venue, join a sailing club as a member,
or buy your own (usually
around $1-5k USD or CAD) and transport it on a car roof rack.

If you are a college student and your school is on a river, lake, or
ocean, then there is probably a sailing club or team that you can
join for free.

If you join a community or college sailing club, then they will
probably require you to take an intro sailing course in order to have
access to their boat. That makes sense. They don't want you to destroy
their boat or hurt someone. So, take the course because you have to.
Then, then forget all of the rules and theory you've
half-learned. Follow through with my method until sailing makes some
sense intuitively and physically. If you start with a course and just
keep taking courses, then you likely will progress more slowly. Pause
and fool around a lot and learn on your own through mistakes.

If you choose to buy a boat, get a used one but don't try to go too
cheap. If a boat costs less than $800 then you probably do not want
it. There's a reason it is so cheap and you aren't yet experienced
enough to know why or fix it. That is, unless your goal is actually to
learn boat repair and disposal instead of sailing. In the worst case,
if you buy a $800 boat and hate the activity, you can probably sell it
to the next person for the same amount.

An inexpensive used boat is also good because you're potentially saving it from
going into the waste stream. Someone with a usable but cheap boat might be tempted 
to throw it out if they can't sell it. Friends and I have rescued many small
boats that were destined for landfill and given them many 
years of life serving new sailors.

Also do not go too expensive. If a boat is expensive because it is
high-end, then it has lots of features that will complicate the
learning process and it is likely less stable--you would not want to
learn to drive in a race car, so don't learn to sail in a racing
boat. Or, an expensive boat might be so because it is in great
condition. Great condition is _bad_ for learning. In a perfect boat you will be too
afraid of damaging the boat to make the mistakes needed to gain
experience. Regardless, you will outgrow this boat and want a nicer,
and maybe larger, one after a year or two. So, don't over-invest in
your first boat.

For your first boat, choose one that cannot be hand launched either
from a dolly (or very light road trailer) or by carrying it to the
water. Having to back a towed trailer down a ramp restricts the places
and times that you can sail. Anything with a centerboard or
daggerboard weighing up to 170 kg (375 lbs) can easily be hand
launched from a dolly. A boat up to 60 kg (130 lbs) can be transported
by car top and carried to water by two adults.

There are [many single-sail dinghies](../dinghies/dinghy1.md.html).
All but the highest performance ones are appropriate to learn on. Some
popular first boats that you may see listed in classified
advertisements are:

- [Laser/ILCA](http://www.laserinternational.org/). There are three sail 
  sizes. The medium "radial"/62 ft^2 one is good for medium teens
  and adults; the small 4.7/50 ft^2 is for smalller sailers; and
  for very light wind or a very large sailor the full/76 ft^2 is fine
- [Sunfish](https://laserperformance.com/boats/sunfish/)/Sailfish
- [O'Pen Skiff](https://www.openskiff.org/), for children
- [RS Neo](w.rssailing.com/project/rs-neo/)
- [RS Zest](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-zest/)
- [RS Quba](https://www.sailaction.com/rs-quba)
- [Optimist](https://www.optican.org/), for children
- [Solo](https://www.solosailing.org.uk/)
- [Invitation](https://www.sailrite.com/Bombardier-Invitation-Sail-Data)
- [Hartley](https://www.hartleyboats.com/) 10, 12, or 12.2
- [Force 5](http://www.force5sailboats.com/)
- [Sabot]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot_(dinghy)")
- [Europe](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/europe-international)
- [Laser Pico](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/laser-pico)
- [Topper Topaz](https://www.topazsailboats.com/)
- [Portland Pudgy](https://portlandpudgy.com/)
- [Byte]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(dinghy)"), for teens or small adults

If you really want to spend a lot of money on a _new_ boat, the RS
Zest and O'Pen BIC are what many sailing clubs uses for solo
learners. They are the most modern designs and very friendly for
beginners. But they are also boats you will quickly level out of. 

The Laser is the classic choice for learning, and it can take you all
of the way up to the Olympics. The best dinghy for you is usually the
one in reasonable condition that is for sale near you; focus on what
is available and not the specifications or brand.

The Optimist is the classic choice for small children in classes. If you
fit into one you are welcome to try it.

Avoid getting a catamaran for your first boat, because they are harder
to recover from a capsize and more challenging to sail upwind.

Avoid a double-handed boat, boat with two sails, or a higher performance
racing boat. Those all will have too much complexity to really learn
the fundamentals, and will be more expensive.



What Next?
========================================================================

Once you have figured out the basics on your own, taking a sailing
course _is_ a great idea. 

Canada's official
[CANSail](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-dinghy/) Dinghy program has
multiple levels that are offered at clubs and schools on the ocean and
inland waterways.

In the UK, the [RYA Dinghy](https://www.rya.org.uk/training/small-boat-sailing/dinghy)
National Sailing Scheme covers small boats from beginnings through advanced racing
techniques.

In the US there is no standardized small boat program, but there are
many great clubs at which to take classes, and colleges often offer
gym classes on sailing to their students.

For larger sailboats, there is the
[Sail Canada Keelboat and Cruising](https://www.sailing.ca/keelboat-cruising/)
program. In the US there are two major sailing programs for much
larger boats.  These are taught at dedicated sailing
schools. [US Sailing](https://www.ussailing.org/education/adult/certification-courses-endorsements/)
has a standardized curriculum and ratings.  The
[American Sailing Association](https://asa.com/certifications/) (ASA)
is a federation of sailing schools with standard certifications and
varying curriculum.

CANSail, Sail Canada, US Sailing, and ASA certifications are only
recognized nationally. The International Certificate of Competency
(ICC Certificate) and International Bareboat Skipper (IBS) are the
only internationally recognized certificates for large recreational
boats, although even those are not universally accepted by charter
companies. 

It takes quite a lot of sailing expertise to reach the point where you
need to think about international certifications, though. If you're a
US sailor on vacation in France who wants to rent a Laser at the
beach, then your credit card is probably the only certification that
you need.
