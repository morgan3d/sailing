Sailing is an ecologically friendly way to enjoy nature, stay fit,
make friends, and have fun. It spans fooling around in bathing
suits at a lake on a warm day, day sailing a river with snacks in hand
and appreciative guests, and weeks spent cruising in fantasy destinations.
The racing side of sailing varies from chasing neighbors around on a 
Wednesday night to international competition and setting ocean speed
records.

I've helped hundreds of people learn to sail.  This is my guide for
getting started with sailing. It is applicable for anyone who is able
to dog paddle with a life jacket on and perform the equivalent of
pulling themselves out of a pool without a ladder. That's all of the
physical capability needed. 

If you are unable to pull yourself out of the water due to aerobic
condition, upper body strength, or a disability, then you can still
sail! Modify the process to include a partner in the boat whose job is
to help you get clear of a capsized boat and help you recover it.
There are also para sailing boats for people with disabilities, so
that everyone can sail. For example, the
[RS Venture](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-venture-connect-scs/)
is designed to be self-righting and not require full use of limbs.
Canada also has a nation-wide
[para sailing education program](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-para/).

The key to learning sailing is to figure things out for yourself at an
intuitive level, on a small boat. If you can avoid it, do not _begin_
by taking a course or having a friend give you detailed instructions
and feedback. Definitely do not let a parent or spouse instruct you or
learn with you until you have the basics locked in.

Those other sources of information are great once you have the
basics. When you first start, I strongly believe that formal lessons
and specific advice just confuse and slow you down.

It is important to begin with a small boat. Making mistakes in a small
boat has little penalty and is often fun. A small boat lets you
directly feel all of the forces at work and experiment with them. The
systems are simple, so you can focus on the most important controls.


The First Time: 10 Steps
=====================================================================

Learning to sail is a simple process. Get a boat, learn to recover
from a capsize, and then figure everything else out on the water
yourself through experimentation. Spelled out in ten steps for your
first day:

1. **Get a boat** and everything from the Equipment section.
3. **Launch your boat** by walking it from the beach into
   shoulder-deep water _without getting in the boat_. Or ride the
   boat away from a dock with a big shove off, and then jump in the
   water. Let go of any concern about getting wet or falling in while sailing, since
   you are already in the water. Aren't you glad that you got that out of the way early?
4. **Capsize the boat** by tipping it over so that the sail is in the water,
   but the boat isn't yet upside down. For example, grab the mast from the water
   and pull it towards you. Try not to hit yourself with the mast or get under the sail
   as you do this.
5. **Swim around the front or back of the boat to what is normally the "bottom"**, which is now vertical like a wall.
   You should end up holding onto the big fin called the "centerboard" or "daggerboard" that is 
   now sticking out sideways. You're wearing a PFD, so this is more like dog paddling or treading water than
   swimming. 
6. **Recover the boat** by hanging on the centerboard from the
   water. You don't need to pull yourself up. Just pull the boat
   down. It will shift sideways as it comes up and not hit you.
7. **Board** by swimming to the back and climbing/clamboring/sliding in. Try not to
   pull on the "tiller" (the stick connected to the fin at the back) as a handle as 
   you do this because that is the only potentially fragile part of the boat. Don't try to
   reboard at the side of the boat on your first try. It is harder.
8. Now, go sailing. **Adjust the sail** by pulling on the rope attached to the "boom" (horizontal pole)
   until it stops flapping, and then let it back out a little until it is just
   about to flap around again. This is how you adjust the sail as you move around. 
   When in doubt, let it out.
9. **Let go of the rope** whenever you want to slow down or stop. The boat only moves
   because you are holding that rope in tight.
9. **Keep your head low** so that it doesn't get hit when the boom swings around.
   You'll figure out when the boom is going to move later. For now, assume it is always
   ready to swing.
10. *Avoid things you don't want to hit.*
   That includes land, rocks, shallow water, other boats, animals, and swimmers.
   Give them at least 10 meters of room, and the more the better.

![A detailed video of capsize recovery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0flyv_GPwwc)

That's it! You'll figure out everything else yourself by trial and
error, and you already know how to handle the normal failure mode of
the boat tipping over.

If you aren't willing to begin your sailing experience by first
jumping into the water, then give up now and go find another sport.
Seriously. You can't learn to sail without getting wet, and it is a
terrible idea to go out in a small boat that you haven't already
practiced recovering from a capsize.

The Second Sail
=======================================================================

For the second time that you go sailing, here are some tips for how to move
your body that may make you more comfortable.

Sit on the side of the boat, not the center or back. Face the sail and
turn your head to look forward. Sit as far forward as you can be
without being in front of the mainsheet (rope from the sail)
attachment. As it gets windier, move your weight further out of the
boat sideways, hooking your feet under the strap if you need it for
balance. The further out and forward that you sit the more room you
will have to move your arms and stay away from the boom.

Hold the mainsheet and tiller (what you steer with) in front of your
chest, with your thumbs pointed in and up. Never let go of either. 
When you need to pull in a lot of mainsheet line, bring it from your
forward hand to your back hand (which is still holding the tiller),
pinch the line under your thumb, and then reach down with your forward
hand to grab more. When you need to ease the mainsheet out, let it run
slowly through your hand.

When you tack or gybe to change which side of the wind the boat is on,
duck and wait until the sail moves over your head. Then, switch sides
while facing forward, _without releasing the mainsheet or
tiller_. Your tiller hand will end up behind your back in your forward
hand and your mainsheet will be in your further aft hand in front of
you. When you are settled in on the new side, switch hands behind your
back. If you are tangled up trying to switch that means that you
turned the wrong way and faced backwards when you crossed the boat.

Avoid the temptation to slouch. Sit with classic good chair posture.
Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and head balanced over your
shoulders. When you are leaning out to balance the boat, keep your
shoulders back and avoid letting the mainsheet and tiller pull them
forward.  This will avoid an aching neck and lower back afterwards.


The Next Few Times
=======================================================================
Once you've done the capsize and recovery the first time, you can skip
those steps in the future. Just launch by getting into the boat and
shoving off. You'll be getting plenty of capsize recovery experience
on the water naturally.

I've noticed that novice sailors often launch from the dock,
presumably to avoid getting wet or because they associate boats with
docks. Experienced dinghy sailors usually launch from a beach when
they have the option. They know that getting wet is normal and that
launching is easier, safer, and less crowded on a beach. If you have a
choice of launching from a beach, do so. You only need to be
waist-deep normally when doing this. Shoulder-deep was just for your
first time capsize recovery.

The first time that the boat naturally capsizes while sailing you may
feel flustered, but you already know how to recover it.  After your
first few recoveries from unexpected capsizes, you'll be confident
that you don't need to worry about falling in the water or the boat
tipping over. And on a hot day, you'll begin to consider this part of
the fun.

After going out by yourself ten times, you'll be able to steer your
boat around and get back to shore confidently. You will also have
plenty of questions at that point, and be ready to understand the
answers to them. 

At that point you are ready for more research and formal learning.
This is the time to explore online guides and videos, books, sailing
courses, and the advice that friends and family are so eager to share.


Equipment
================================================================

What you need:

- A PFD ("life jacket"), which you'll wear at all times.
- An old **single-handed catboat dinghy**, such as a Laser, Sunfish, or 
  if you are very small, an Optimist. The boat should be sufficiently
  well used so that you don't worry about damaging it a little.
- 8-16 kph (5-10 mph, 4-8 kts) of wind.
- A bailer, if your boat has a deep cockpit. Boats with shallow
  or self-draining cockpits such as a Laser, Sunfish, or RS Zest don't 
  need this. A bailer is just a plastic jug with the top screwed on
  and the bottom cut off, so that you can bail water out of the boat.
  Tie it on to the mast so that you don't lose it.
- Waterproof sunscreen and a hat or complete UV blocking clothing
  coverage, depending on the season.
- A wetsuit or bathing suit, depending on the season. Do not wear
  street clothes, which will be heavy and cold when wet. Wear swimming clothes.
- A plastic or metal bottle of drinking water.
- A safety whistle, tied to your PFD and tucked in where it can't catch on
  anything. 
- Someone to sail a separate boat near you, or to watch you from the
  shore as a lifeguard, if you are in a location without a lot of
  other people around. This person is only there for true emergencies,
  such as if you are struck by another boat. They shouldn't help if
  your boat capsizes normally and you're able to recover, or if you
  are simply confused and drifting in an unfortunate
  direction. Mistakes that do not threaten injury are your own problem
  and part of the learning process.

You do _not_ need sailing boots, sailing gloves, a radio, anchor,
flares, life buoy, a trailer, a large boat, a motor, or any sort of
license to start with a dinghy.

You do _not_ need to know how to tie knots, what the parts of the boat
are called, starboard and port, the navigation rules, lifesaving
techniques, storm techniques, racing rules, or anything else. (You don't
need to know navigation rules because you're staying far away from 
all other boats at first.)

You don't even need to know how to swim, since you are wearing your
PFD at all times.

Like a bicycle, learning to sail when moving too slowly is actually
harder than when going a little faster. If there's less than 8 kph of
wind, hold out for a better day. If there's more than 20 kph it
will be obvious to you that you aren't ready for that.

Rain and light fog are fine for sailing. Cloudy days are ideal. Do not
sail if there's any chance of a thunderstorm. You are going to be
sitting next to a giant metal pole that is the highest point around,
surrounded by water. 

Don't sail a small boat in water that is unsafe to swim in due to
pollution, current, temperature, breaking waves, dangerous wildlife
(such as jellyfish, orcas, stingrays, or sharks), or underwater hazards.


Canadian Regulations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Canada, all small sailboats are
[required](https://tc.canada.ca/sites/default/files/migrated/tp_511e.pdf)
to have on board:

- A PFD. Be smart. Wear it.
- A sound signalling device--that's your whistle.
- A manual propulsion mechanism, such as a paddle. _I
  consider my rudder and my hands to satisfy this requirement
  for a small sailboat. I know many people who strap a small emergency
  paddle to their mast or boom as well._
- A bailer, _which is "not required for a boat that cannot
  hold enough water to make it capsize or a boat that has watertight
  compartments that are sealed and not readily accessible",
  such as a Laser or RS Zest._
- 15 meters (50') of line for heaving and towing. _Your mainsheet tied
  to your halyard or painter is probably long enough. Most small boats
  have 12m of halyard and 13m of mainsheet_.

Boats engaged in a class or formal racing in good conditions that are
also accompanied by a safety boat (which can be the committee boat)
are exempted from these rules. Regardless, you should always wear your
PFD and carry a whistle, and if your boat needs it, carry a bailer. It
is only the tow line and paddle requirement that make sense to be
exempted from when in a fleet.


How to Get a Boat
=====================================================================
To get the boat you can borrow one from a friend, buy your own (usually
around $1-5k USD or CAD) and transport it on a car roof rack, rent at
a tourist sailing venue, or join a sailing club as a member. If you are
a college student and your school is on a river, lake, or ocean, then
there is probably a sailing club or team that you can join.

If you join a sailing club, they will probably require you to take an
intro sailing course in order to have access to their boat. That makes
sense. They don't want you to destroy their boat or hurt someone. So,
take the course because you have to. Then, then forget all of the
rules and theory you've half-learned. Follow through with my method
until sailing makes some sense intuitively and physically. If you
start with a course and just keep taking courses, then you likely will
progress more slowly. Pause and fool around a lot and learn on your
own through mistakes.

If you're buying a first boat, don't try to go too cheap. If a boat
costs less than $1000 then you probably do not want it. There's a
reason it is so cheap and you aren't yet experienced enough to know
why or fix it. That is, unless your goal is actually to learn boat repair
and disposal instead of sailing.

Also do not go too expensive. If a boat is expensive because it is
high-end, then it has lots of features that will complicate the
learning process and it is likely less stable--you would not want to
learn to drive in a race car, so don't learn to sail in a racing
boat. Or, an expensive boat might be so because it is in great
condition, and then you will be too afraid of damaging the boat to
make the mistakes needed for learning. Regardless, you will outgrow
this boat and want a nicer, and maybe larger, one after a year or
two. So, don't over-invest in your first boat.

For your first boat, avoid one that cannot be hand launched either
from a dolly (or very light road trailer) or by carrying it to the
water. Having to back a towed trailer down a ramp restricts the places
and times that you can sail. Anything with a centerboard or
daggerboard weighing up to 170 kg (375 lbs) can easily be hand
launched from a dolly. A boat up to 60 kg (130 lbs) can be transported
by car top and carried to water by two adults.

There are [many single-sail dinghies](../dinghies/dinghy1.md.html).
All but the highest performance ones are appropriate to learn
on. Some popular first boats are:

- [Laser/ILCA](http://www.laserinternational.org/), for large teens and adults
- [Laser/ILCA](http://www.laserinternational.org/) 4.7 or Radial, for lighter teens and adults
- [Sunfish](https://laserperformance.com/boats/sunfish/)/Sailfish
- [O'Pen Skiff](https://www.openskiff.org/), for children
- [RS Neo](w.rssailing.com/project/rs-neo/)
- [RS Zest](https://www.rssailing.com/project/rs-zest/)
- [RS Quba](https://www.sailaction.com/rs-quba)
- [Optimist](https://www.optican.org/), for children
- [Solo](https://www.solosailing.org.uk/)
- [Invitation](https://www.sailrite.com/Bombardier-Invitation-Sail-Data)
- [Hartley](https://www.hartleyboats.com/) 10, 12, or 12.2
- [Force 5](http://www.force5sailboats.com/)
- [Sabot]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabot_(dinghy)")
- [Europe](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/europe-international)
- [Laser Pico](https://sailboatdata.com/sailboat/laser-pico)
- [Topper Topaz](https://www.topazsailboats.com/)
- [Portland Pudgy](https://portlandpudgy.com/)
- [Byte]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(dinghy)"), for teens or small adults

If you really want to spend a lot of money on a _new_ boat, the RS
Zest and O'Pen BIC are what my own sailing club uses for solo
learners. They are the most modern designs and very friendly for
beginners. But they are also boats you will quickly level out of. 

The Laser is the classic choice for learning, and it can take you all
of the way up to the Olympics. The best dinghy for you is usually the
one in reasonable condition that is for sale near you; focus on what
is available and not the specifications or brand.

Avoid getting a catamaran for your first boat, because they are harder
to recover from a capsize and more challenging to sail upwind.

Avoid a double-handed boat, boat with two sails, or a higher performance
racing boat. Those all will have too much complexity to really learn
the fundamentals, and will be more expensive.



What Next?
========================================================================

Once you have figured out the basics on your own, taking a sailing
course _is_ a great idea. 

Canada's official
[CANSail](https://www.sailing.ca/cansail-dinghy/) Dinghy program has
multiple levels that are offered at clubs and schools on the ocean and
inland waterways.

In the UK, the [RYA Dinghy](https://www.rya.org.uk/training/small-boat-sailing/dinghy)
National Sailing Scheme covers small boats from beginnings through advanced racing
techniques.

In the US there is no standardized small boat program, but there are
many great clubs at which to take classes, and colleges often offer
gym classes on sailing to their students.

For larger sailboats, there is the
[Sail Canada Keelboat and Cruising](https://www.sailing.ca/keelboat-cruising/)
program. In the US there are two major sailing programs for much
larger boats.  These are taught at dedicated sailing
schools. [US Sailing](https://www.ussailing.org/education/adult/certification-courses-endorsements/)
has a standardized curriculum and ratings.  The
[American Sailing Association](https://asa.com/certifications/) (ASA)
is a federation of sailing schools with standard certifications and
varying curriculum.

CANSail, Sail Canada, US Sailing, and ASA certifications are only
recognized nationally. The International Certificate of Competency
(ICC Certificate) and International Bareboat Skipper (IBS) are the
only internationally recognized certificates for large recreational
boats, although even those are not universally accepted by charter
companies. 

It takes quite a lot of sailing expertise to reach the point where you
need to think about international certifications, though. If you're a
US sailor on vacation in France who wants to rent a Laser at the
beach, then your credit card is probably the only certification that
you need.
