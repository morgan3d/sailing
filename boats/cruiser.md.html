Below are metrics for a set of mid-sized monohull cruising
sailboats. These include boats that I personally fantasize about
sailing (♥) as well as many other well-known boats. That includes some
at both the short and long extremes of the shorthanded cruising range to
provide more context and options for folks with different criteria
than me. The boats below are sorted by increasing length overall.  The
metrics and their relevance are explained below the table.

![The Southerly 42 isn't as fast as it looks, but gets you there in style and with great accomodations.](southerly42.png)

I'm not _recommending_ these particular boats, although each certainly
has something to commend it for different types of sailing. As you can
read in the following notes, I'm also not suggesting that it is a good
idea to make decisions based on these numbers without getting on the
boats in person and considering many other factors. Instead, I found
it useful to see the data on them side-by-side to hold up against my
other observations to measure their suitability for my favorite kind
of cruising.

That is, the metrics listed are the ones I use for rough comparison of
cruisers before making a more nuanced evaluation of those that seem
interesting. So, these metrics and the notes reflect some of what is
important to _me_ for shorthanded and solo _coastal cruising_ in the
higher end of _mid lattitudes_, rather than universal boat evaluation
properties. That's a good boat for sailing the coast of Maine, Vancouver
Island, or the Baltic by myself. That's different from what you might
want as a couple in the Bahamas, two couples cruising the Mediteranean,
or frequent open ocean passages.

Boat yards go out of business frequently, and brands are bought and
consolidated. Beware that even some of the recently introduced models
listed above are either no longer available new, or are available but
the ownership of the yard has changed hands. The previous reputation
may no longer apply to new production standards, for better or for
worse.

# Metrics

## Role

My interpretation of the role this boat is suited for based
on its specifications and target market. 
  
Weekender
: Weekend getaway sleepover, day sailer, occasional racer, fair weather
  coastal weekend cruising...and frequently, designed for
  Mediterranean and Caribbean charter.
  
Coastal
: Can live aboard, weeks to months coastal cruising, and short, fair
  weather passages.
    
Bluewater
: Cross oceans, safely handle heavy weather, suitable to live aboard
  full time. Some (such as Southerly) lean towards more bulletproof
  coastal cruising and others (such as Kraken) for true exploration,
  including handling ice in high lattitudes.
    
Of course, with care and luck, any boat can cross an ocean. With
persistence or desperation, any boat can be lived aboard. And if you
don't care about winning, any boat can race.

## Exterior

You can judge for yourself. Hover over or click on the 
images to zoom in. As much as possible, I selected photographs of the boats under sail, 
from the perspective of another nearby boat on the beam, and 
with cruising dodgers, biminis, and solar panels.
That gives a fairly accurate comparison
of what what the boat actually looks like on the water for coastal cruising. 
In contrast, every sailboat looks best charging 
at the camera and from above, while heeling with a rigged spinnaker and stripped of the exterior fittings that make them
livable.

Sometimes form follows function, and sometimes
not for boats. What looks high performance or sturdy may not actually be so in boats,
the same as for houses and cars. So, I don't read too much into the appearance, even though 
I love an attractive yacht that is well-suited to its chosen role. 

There are a few common styles that designers lean into for different markets. Here's what 
the styling says to me (even if the boat may or may not deliver in its performance):

Racer
: Looks stripped down and built for speed. Like a Ferrari, Pagani, or other supercar
  and probably built with the same carbon fiber. 
  
Performance Cruiser
: Modern styling and looks fast enough, but also 
  comfortable. What most people expect a sailboat to look like.
  Midrange practical sports car equivalent, like a BMW.
  
Classic Cruiser
: Respectable 1970s cruiser lines. Old-school but attractive.
  Like the Volvo or Saab of boats. 

Pilothouse Cruiser
: Pragmatic trawler appearance for good protection in weather and 
  interior headroom and visibility at the expense of performance lines.
  If it was a car, it would be a minivan.

Expedition
: Combines styling cues from the above three with high-lattitude
  looks to turn pragmatic into more adventurous appearance. Wouldn't be out of place in a National Geographic special. This is the 
  offroad SUV of boats.
  
Luxury
: Styling cues that invoke a baby superyacht of the rich
  and famous, usually Performance Cruiser styling taken to the next
 level. Like luxury performance sedan: Jaguar, Aston-Martin, etc.

## Pilot House

Can this boat be piloted from inside a protected, heated deckhouse/pilothouse
with a chart table? Some boats have very large windows, but they are
intended more as skylights than for standing watch inside. The traditional
pilot house looks like a shed on top of the cockpit. Modern designs
improve on this with a decksaloon that includes nav station steering 
and 180 degrees or better visibility.
  
For a weekend sailer, a deckhouse is more often a drawback than a feature due to
reduced _external_ helm visibility.
  
For extended cruising, especially in mid and high lattitudes, being
able to stand watch inside is extraordinary. It reduces fatigue and
increases safety in storms offshore. 
  
Many of the boats that enable deckhouse piloting also have raised
saloons, making daily living aboard brighter and more welcoming. The
Sirius boats go one further and raise the galley as well.

## First Year

Year of first production. Very recent boats haven't had the design
validated in practice and may have years of shakedown refinements
and wisdom still coming. Much older boats may be missing out on
newer advances in materials and systems, as well as hull shape
refinement.

## LOA

Length overall, which may include bowsprits, rear arches, and
davits. This affects maneuverability, maintenance cost, and moorage
cost. The cost of ownership, weight, and volume are all nonlinear in
the overall length.
  
A 40' boat may cost $1.5\times$ as much as a 35' boat for initial
price, moorage fees, and ongoing maintenance--but may also have
surprisingly more interior volume.
  
Length is seductive, but the classic wisdom is "buy the _smallest_
boat that you can afford."

## LWL

Length of the waterline, which affects hull speed and performance.

## Beam

Maximum width of the boat. This affects accomodation volume,
stability, and maneuverability in a marina. A wider boat has more
initial stability but is less stable once it begins to be knocked
down.


## SA/D 

This is referred to as "Sail Area / Displacement", but is not a direct ratio.
The equation is:

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\mbox{``SA/D''} &=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\mbox{ft}^2]}{\left(\mbox{displacement} ~ [\mbox{ft}^3]\right)^{2/3}} = \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\operatorname{ft}^2]}{\left(\frac{1}{64} \mbox{displacement}~[\operatorname{lbs}]\right)^{2/3}} \\
\nonumber
&=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\mbox{m}^2]}{\left(\mbox{displacement}~[\mbox{m}^3]\right)^{2/3}}
\end{eqnarray}

Higher is generally better for making way under sail, but a high
performance boat may be harder to handle in foul weather.

A [common interpretation](https://www.sailmagazine.com/boats/comparing-design-ratios) is:

Below 15
: Under powered/motor sailer

15 to 18
: Reasonably good performance for cruising

Above 18 
: Racing, high performance
  
However, SA/D numbers have huge error bars because the headsail area
is variable. Cruisers are often quoted with their working jib instead
of the genoa they'd use in typical 10 kt wind. That genoa might add
another 30% total sail area and thus 30% higher SA/D. It is also a
coarse measure because it does not consider the hull's shape, only its
displacement.
  
The ideal information for analyzing true performance is a
[polar plot](https://distantshores.ca/boatblog_files/sailing-polar-performance.php)
computed for the boat with the appropriate sails for different wind
conditions and wind strengths. That shows how fast the boat moves at
different points of sail, which can vary radically across boat
designs. Also consider the ability and size of the crew, the load, and
the sea conditions under which you expect to sail, which can affect
performance as much as the rig and wind.
  
In the US units version of the SA/D equation that measures
displacement in pounds, I believe that the division by 64 is a
conversion from weight to cubic feet of displacement based on the
specific gravity of water. The 2/3 power is then converting the cubic
feet of displacement volume to square feet of effective wetted area,
producing a unitless ratio.
  
Note that all monohulls in displacement mode (and laden cruisers don't
plane upwind) have an effective maximum
[hull speed](http://staging4.wavetrain.net/2010/03/26/crunching-numbers-why-longer-is-faster/)
in knots through the water of $1.3 \sqrt{\operatorname{LWL}~[\mbox{ft}]} = 2.4 \sqrt{\operatorname{LWL}~[\mbox{m}]} = \sqrt{\frac{\operatorname{LWL}~[\operatorname{m}] \times g}{2\pi}}, g = 9.81~\operatorname{m}/\operatorname{s}^2$. 
This will be 7-8 kts for any mid-sized cruiser. The performance questions are
largely how much wind is needed to reach that hull speed (which SA/D
helps indicate) and how high the boat can point (which is indicated by
a polar or track tacking angle).

## Comfort Ratio

$\mbox{CR} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{65} \mbox{displacement}~[\mbox{lbs}]}{100 \left(70\%~\mbox{LWL}~[\mbox{ft}^2] + 30\%~\mbox{LOA}~[\mbox{ft}^2]\right) \cdot (\mbox{beam}~[\mbox{ft}^2])^\frac{4}{3}}$

Higher is generally better. Note that "comfort" for a boat reflects
the motion in waves, not the level of luxury.
 
I suspect that the 1/65 in the denominator is converting the
displacement from feet to pounds (it should probably have been 1/64 to
match CSF, but this is the standard equation).
 
This ratio was created by Ted Brewer as a measure of motion comfort.
It was initially something of a joke and then later found to be
genuinely informative. It provides a reasonable comparison between
yachts of similar size and type.

  - Below 20 = lightweight racing boat;
  - 20 to 30 = coastal cruiser;
  - 30 to 40 = moderate bluewater cruising boat;
  - 40 to 50 = heavy bluewater boat;
  - Over 50  = extremely heavy bluewater boat.

Beware that for cruisers, the displacement listed for the boat is
probably significantly lighter than once tanks are full and provisions
and gear are loaded aboard. So, the comfort ratios are generally lower
than what is accurate.

## Capsize Screening Formula (CSF)

$\mbox{CSF} = \dfrac{\mbox{beam}~[\mbox{ft}]}{\left(\frac{1}{64} \mbox{displacement}~[\mbox{lbs}]\right)^\frac{1}{3}}$

Measurement of stability for open ocean (large wave) sailing. The CSF
compares beam with displacement since excess beam contributes to
capsize and heavy displacement reduces capsize vulnerability. The boat
is better suited for ocean passages (vs. coastal cruising) if the
result of the calculation is less than or equal to 2.0. Basically, a
monohull is more stable with a narrow beam and a heavy keel for both
resisting knockdown and recovering from it.
  
There are many factors in stability and this is only a coarse guide.
The hull shape, weight aloft and sail shape, and ballast distribution
have a large effect. The real information desired is at what heel
point the boat capsizes, how well it recovers from a knockdown, and
how well it recovers (or whether it can recover at all) from a roll.
  
The
[angle of vanishing stability](http://sailskills.co.uk/Stability/sailskills_stability_stability_explained_AVS.html),
the area of negative stability, and overall
[GZ curve](https://marine.marsh-design.com/content/understanding-monohull-sailboat-stability-curves)
are the real data desired. These are not easily available for all
boats and are not as simple to filter on for a first cut. Any Category
A-rated yacht must have at least a 130 degree AVS. Most will also have
maximum righting moment close to 60 degrees. 

That means that such a
boat is designed to recover even with the mast well into the
water--albeit, only when appropriately loaded and with hatches and companionway
sealed. A modern coastal cruiser with a wide beam and a shallow fin
keel is likely less stable than a traditional bluewater boat with a
heavy, full keel, narrow beam, and probably less sail aloft. 

However,
one of the advantages of coastal cruising is that extreme conditions 
can usually be waited out rather than navigated. Overbuilding
for waves and wind they'll never sail in at the expense of better
performance or accomodations is not a good tradeoff for most owners.

## Draft

How far the boat (mostly, the keel) sticks down under the waterline.
For many boats there are a few keel depth options at build time.  Some
also have lifting or swing keels that can become much shallower when
anchoring or motoring in coastal areas. In general, a higher draft is
more stable and faster upwind. A lower draft is more practical for
tidal and shallow coast areas.

## Mainsheet

How is the mainsheet attached and trimmed? 

*Mid-boom* sheeting keeps the cockpit completely clear of the sheet,
so is convenient for life at anchor and safer in an uncontrolled gybe
when sailing.
  
*Boom end* sheeting provides better leverage and imposes less bending
on the boom, so is preferred in heavy weather to mid-boom.  Boom end
sheeting combined with attachment behind the helm station or on an
arch combines some of the safety of mid-boom sheeting with the
strength of the boom end.
  
*Coachroof* sheeting is hard for the helmsperson to handle without
using autopilot, and so is not ideal for solo or even shorthanded
sailors. However, it is very convenient and safe for keeping the
working part of the mainsheet completely out of the cockpit.
  
A *traveller* gives more sail control than a single point. It makes it
easy to quickly spill the main in a gust and allows independent
downward and inward trim of the main.

A single point main sheeted to the cockpit sole in front of the helm
is potentially the most dangerous. In an uncontrolled gybe, the
working part of the sheet can sweep the entire cockpit.

My preference is boom-end sheeting on a traveller behind the helm.
That is relatively safe and strong, as well as suitable for
shorthanded sailing. The helmsperson can spill air themselves by
freeing the traveler in a gust, and is able to trim the sheet without
moving far from the helm. This configuration is only possible when the
boom extends past the helm. The primary drawbacks are that this blocks
access to the stern of the boat when leaving, and can limit the
options for a bimini for weather protection for the helmsperson.
  

## Keel

What type of keel does the boat have? There are two main
issues. Attachment type and shape.

An encapsulated keel is stronger than a bolted on one. Beware that
"encapsulated iron" is not an encapsulated _keel_. That is a keel
where the iron ballast is sealed in to prevent rust. Some people would
not sail bluewater passages with a bolt on keel.  There are many
styles of bolt on keel, with radically varying strength and
inspectability.
  
There are three major keel shapes. A *fin keel* provides better upwind
pointing and is much easier to maneuver in a marina. A *full keel*
provides better heavy weather control and leads to more comfortable
motion. A *long-chord fin keel* is a compromise between the two,
and is similar to a full keel with a cut away forefoot.
  
Some boats do not have fixed keels. Various forms of centerboard and
lifting keel allow the boat to moor in shallow areas or dry out with
the tide. A keel that moves is of course a very serious potential
failure point, although many expedition yachts still opt for them.
 
*Twin keels* are dual side-by-side keels. These allow a boat to dry
out without being attached to a wall (for maintenance or mooring in
shallow water or high tidal areas) and generally give good stability
with shallower drafts than a single keel. If they do run aground while
traveling upwind they may free themselves, as they have less draft
when upright then while heeled. However, running aground downwind is
far worse because the boat can't be heeled to free it.

Modern twin keels are efficient and manufactures claim that their
performance is equal to fin keels [^Bray][^Sirius][^RM]. However,
older long-chord twin keel designs significantly limited pointing when
sailing upwind. These are often also called bilge keels, but
technically bilge keels are a similar pair of short keels for
stabilization in addition to a central keel.

Shallow keels often have a bulb to reduce tip vortices and increase
keel ballast and righting moment without a deep draft. Full and 
long-chord keels are naturally shallower than fin keels because
they distribute their mass along the length and do not need as much
depth.

## Rudder

A *skeg-hung rudder* is protected from underwater collision damage and
stronger under high loads than a spade rudder. Some people consider a
boat without one unacceptable for coastal, let alone bluewater
cruising.
  
A *twin rudder* provides better steerage and can help prevent
broaching when heeling, and may be more efficient. Twin rudders are
harder to maneuver backwards under power when docking because they
receive no prop wash. Some twin rudder designs provide redundancy
in the event of certain kinds of steering failure.
  

## Rig

*Sloop* rigs are the default today. *Solent* rigs are sloops with
multiple forestays close together. That allows changing sails by
furling and unfurling instead of going forward to the bow. They have
the drawback that only the innermost sail can be tacked; the others
have to be furled for each tack! 
  
A *cutter* rig has an inset forestay to avoid the tacking problem with
multiple headsails, and even allows multiple headsails to be flown
together. They are beautiful and can be very effective, but are
compromised for smaller boats. They only work on a small boat with a
correspondingly small stormsail, and the extra deck bracing reduces
headroom in the forward cabin. For larger boats, the cutter stay
usually requires more complicated running backstays to adjust and
handle the fractional mast point tension.
  
*Ketches* and *yawls* are almost impossible to find in production
today. They are great for shorthanded and heavy weather cruising, but
require more work to sail than a sloop and double the mainsail
and rigging maintenance costs.

# Limitations of Metrics

There are other derived metrics that help track boat motion and
performance, such as S#, Ballast/Displacement, and
Displacement/Length. I find that the SA/D, Comfort, and Capsize
tend to capture most of this at a high level when comparing across
a large number of boats.

Consider the numbers reported to have large error bars for three
reasons.  First, they vary for a given boat across exact models and
are measured differently by different manufacturers. Second, they are
reported differently across source sites.

Third and most important, the numbers don't exactly correspond to the
properties of the boat. For example, a boat with a longer waterline
should have a higher hull speed. However, that waterline varies with
how the boat is loaded and how much it is heeling, and its impact on
hullspeed is affected by the bow and stern profiles. 

The derived quantities such as "comfort ratio" (which is itself a
controversial metric) and "capsize screening formula" help compare
similar boats with significant differences in those values, but are
not comparable across radically different types of boats. They are
also not so accurate that a few percent difference actually indicates
an advantage.

# New vs. Used 

![Now semi-custom and under new ownership, the Island Packet 349 may be the last traditional 35' cruiser in production. It boasts a full keel, cutter rig, and conservative ocean going hull shape paired with modern internal systems.](islandpacket349.jpg)
You may notice that this list favored boats that are currently in
production. These tend to take advantage of modern advances and are
frankly luxurious by older cruising standards. 

Buying a used boat and upgrading it is more common than buying a new
boat. There are a large number of 1970s and 1980s cruisers in the
30-40' range available. Many of those older boats are far better
designed for shorthanded bluewater passages at that size than newer
boats. They are also 10-30x less expensive than newer boats at the
same length!

However, while there is a lot of stock generally available, any
specific classic cruiser can be hard to find in good condition. When
found, they'll likely be highly modified from their original
specifications, too, making a table of metrics less useful. So, I do
not list many older boats beyond the key representatives shown.
That isn't to say that one shouldn't seek out a boat from the golden
age of cruising. It is just that shopping for a specific one is very
difficult, and being open to a wider range of options becomes important.

I also favor recent designs because there were some radical advances
in cruisers around 2000, and then again around 2018. New materials and
computer simulation and modeling enabled great improvements in safety
(...or cost; vendors made different tradeoffs), features, and usable
interior volume. There is often a very large difference between a 1990
boat, a 2005 boat, and a 2020 boat even from the same vendor.

Unfortunately, as designs and materials advanced, the market also
shifted towards larger, luxury boats and charter boats. The sweet spot
of 30' to 40' shorthanded cruisers is not as well populated as it once
was. Boats are quickly getting larger and more expensive. 

# Cost

Cost is the most significant factor when choosing a boat, and one not
addressed here. It varies across the boats listed from about US$30k to
well over US$1M. I don't list the prices because they are highly
variable for used boats based on location and condition and for new
boats based on the market and production costs. Ultimately, a boat
costs far more in operating costs than it does to purchase, so even
the purchase cost would be misleading.

# Accomodation

![The Sirius 40DS interior is like a TARDIS, due to two accomodation levels. Three full berths, all standing headroom, a technical room, and two heads in 42' LOA.](sirius40ds.jpg)

Interior layout is of course crucial for cruising, however, it varies
so much across boats of the same model due to options and owner
modifications that I did not list them. Most of these boats have two
cabins with double berths, fore and aft, and the seating in the saloon
serves as an additional single berth. Classic cruisers may have multiple
center berths in the saloon area.

There are three interesting layout exceptions. Sirius boats have a
central cabin _underneath_ the saloon in addition to the optional aft
cabin. Moody DS boats also have one or two central cabins under the
saloon, but no aft cabin. Valiants and Vancouvers have a front cabin,
a central cabin/pilot berth at the foot of the companionway, and no
aft cabin.

A central berth, in a cabin or on the saloon seating, is the best
place to sleep when on a passage or at a poorly protected
anchorage. The boat's rotational motion is minimized there, close to
the center of mass. The sound of waves on the bow and stern is far
away, there's maximal headroom, and there's probably easier access to
the heads and companionway.

A large separate shower and toilet area are desirable for coastal
cruising in protected water and living at anchor. But for sailing in wet
and cold conditions, having the toilet close to the companionway
avoids crossing the saloon in wet gear or while being tossed around. A
toilet facing fore or aft and surrounded with close bracing can be
used safely and on either tack while heeling. A separate shower is nice
even underway for keeping the toilet area dry, but it also needs to have seating to be used safely.

Similarly, at sea or in poorly protected anchorages a tight U-shaped
galley with a bracing strap is safe. In a protected anchorage, more
counterspace and storage in the galley is better. 

A sink closer to the center of the boat drains better when heeling,
but most layouts conserve center space by pushing the sink towards the
outside of the hull.


# Mast and Hull

Hull thickness is important in areas with significant underwater
obstructions or ice. 

There are several tradeoffs in how a mast is stepped. A deck stepped
mast is good for performance because it is flexible, and leaves more
room for accomodation below decks.

A keel stepped mast has advantages in failure conditions. It is less
likely to fail catastrophically when stays are lost. If it breaks in a
severe storm at sea, it is more likely to leave a stump up to the first
spreader that can be jury-rigged to sail to safety. 

However, if a keel stepped mast completely fails, then it will rip a
hole in the coachroof.  This will happen in the kind of conditions
where it is very dangerous to not be able to seal the boat, because it is
rolling over or taking on seas.

# Tradeoffs

Everything about boat design is a tradeoff between performance, cost,
safety, crew required, manueverability in port, maintainability, and
so on. A boat that is OK at everything excels at nothing. A boat that
is very fast is probably uncomfortable in heavy seas and impractical
for extended cruising. A hardcore bluewater cruiser is likely
overbuilt and compromised for weekend trips and daysailing.

For example, my ideal cruiser would have the rig and keel of Rustler
or Island Packet, the class and exterior styling of Wauquiez, the
interior magic and bulletproof hull of Sirius, the performance and
internal systems of Kraken, and the price and availability of
Jeanneau. It's simply not possible to combine any two of those, let
alone all of them. Each of those yards specializes in something and
compromises other areas in order to excel.
