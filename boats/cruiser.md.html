![The Southerly 42 isn't as fast as it looks, but gets you there in style and with great accomodations.](southerly42.png)

The metrics listed are the ones I use for rough comparison of cruisers
before making a more nuanced evaluation of those that seem
interesting. So, these metrics reflect some of what is important to
_me_ for _coastal cruisers_ in mid lattitudes, rather than universal
boat evaluation properties.

Interior layout is of course crucial for cruising, however, it varies
so much across boats of the same model due to options and owner
modifications that I did not list them. Most of these boats have two
cabins with double berths, fore and aft, and then a saloon single
berth. There are three interesting exceptions. Sirius boats also have
a central cabin _underneath_ the saloon. Moody DS boats also have one
or two central cabins under the saloon, but no aft cabin. Valiants and
Tanya Vancouvers have a central cabin at the foot of the companionway
and no aft cabin.

Role
: My interpretation of the role this boat is suited for based
  on its specifications and target market. 
  
  - Charter = weekender, day sailer, occasional racer, fair weather
    coastal weekend cruising...and probably designed for
    Mediterranean and Caribbean rentals.
  - Coastal = can live aboard, weeks to months coastal cruising, and short fair
    weather passages.
  - Bluewater = cross oceans, safely handle heavy weather, 
    suitable to live aboard full time. Some (such as Southerly) lean towards
    more bulletproof coastal cruising and others (such as Kraken) for true exploration, including
    handling ice in high lattitudes.
    
  Of course, with care and luck, any boat can cross an ocean. With
  persistence or desperation, any boat can be lived aboard. And if you
  don't care about winning, any boat can race.
    
Styling
: Independent of how the boat functions, what it _looks_ like to me from 
  the exterior styling in terms of branding.
  
  - Racer = Stripped down and built for speed. Like a Ferrari, Pagani, or other supercar
    and probably built with the same carbon fiber.
  - Racer-Cruiser = modern styling and looks fast enough, but also 
    comfortable. What most people expect a sailboat to look like.
    Midrange practical sports car equivalent, like a BMW.
  - Classic Cruiser = respectable 1970s cruiser lines. Old-school but attractive.
    Like the Volvo or Saab station wagon of boats.
  - Motorsailer = pragmatic trawler appearance, usually as the tradeoff
    for good interior visibility and headroom. Won't win any beauty contests.
    If it was a car, it would be a minivan.
  - Expedition = combines styling cues from the above three with high-lattitude
    looks. Wouldn't be out of place in a National Geographic special. This is the 
    offroad SUV of boats.
  - Luxury = styling cues that invoke a baby superyacht of the rich and famous, 
    usually Racer-Cruiser styling taken to the next level. Like luxury performance 
    sedan: Jaguar, Aston-Martin, etc.

Deckhouse
: Can this boat be piloted from inside a protected, heated deckhouse with a
  chart table? Some boats have very large windows, but they are intended more
  as skylights than for standing watch inside.

First Year
: Year of production. Very recent boats haven't had the design
  validated in practice. Much older boats may be missing out
  on recent advances.

LOA
: Length overall. This affects maneuverability, maintenance cost,
  and moorage cost. In practice, the cost of ownership is nonlinear
  in the overall length.

LWL
: Length of the waterline, which affects hull speed and performance.

Beam
: Maximum width of the boat. This affects accomodation volume,
  stability, and maneuverability in a marina.

SA/D ("Sail Area / Displacement")
: SA/D = (SA in ft²) ÷ ((Displacement in lbs) / 64) ^ 0.666

  Higher is generally better, but a high performance boat
  may be harder to handle in foul weather.

  - Below 16 = under powered/motor sailer
  - 16 to 20 = reasonably good performance for cruising
  - Above 20 = racing high performance
  
  The division by 64 is a conversion from weight to cubic feet of displacement
  based on the specific gravity of water. The 2/3 power is then 
  converting the cubic feet to square feet, producing a unitless ratio.

Comfort Ratio
: CR = (Displacement in lbs) ÷ (0.65 x (0.7 (LWL in ft) + 0.3 (LOA in ft)) x (Beam in ft) ^ 1.33)
 
  Higher is generally better. Note that "comfort" for a boat reflects
  the motion in waves, not the level of luxury.
  
  The 0.65 in the denominator is converting the denominator from feet
  to pounds (it should probably have been 64/100, but this is the
  standard equation).
 
  This a ratio was created by Ted Brewer as a measure of motion
  comfort, initially as something of a joke and then found to be
  useful. It provides a reasonable comparison between yachts of similar
  size and type. It is based on the fact that the faster the motion the
  more upsetting it is to the average person. Consider, though, that the
  typical summertime coastal cruiser will rarely encounter the wind and
  seas that an ocean going yacht will meet.

  - Below 20 = lightweight racing boat;
  - 20 to 30 = coastal cruiser;
  - 30 to 40 = moderate bluewater cruising boat;
  - 40 to 50 = heavy bluewater boat;
  - Over 50  = extremely heavy bluewater boat.
  

Capsize Screening Formula (CSF)
: CSF = (Beam in ft) / (Disp in cubic ft) ^ 0.333. The displacement in cubic feet can be found by dividing the displacement in pounds by 64.

  Lower is better.

  Designed to determine if a boat has blue water capability. The CSF
  compares beam with displacement since excess beam contributes to
  capsize and heavy displacement reduces capsize vulnerability. The boat
  is better suited for ocean passages (vs coastal cruising) if the
  result of the calculation is 2.0 or less.

Draft
: How far the boat (mostly, the keel) sticks down under the waterline.
  For many boats there are a few keel depth options at build time.
  Some also have lifting or swing keels that can become much shallower
  when anchoring or motoring in coastal areas. In general, a higher
  draft is more stable and faster upwind. A lower draft is more practical
  for tidal and shallow coast areas.

Mainsheet
: How is the mainsheet attached? A main on a coachroof is hard for the
  helmsperson to handle, and may require a larger crew. A main sheeted
  from the boom end provides better leverage and imposes less bending
  on the boom, so is preferred in heavy weather. A traveller gives more
  sail control. Attachment behind the helm station, on an arch, or on the coachroof
  is safer than a mainsheet that attaches in the middle of the cockpit
  and could sweep the cockpit in an accidental gybe.
  
Keel
: What type of keel does the boat have? An encapsulated keel is
  stronger than a bolt on one. Some people would not sail bluewater
  passages with a bolt-on keel. A fin keel provides better upwind
  pointing and is much easier to maneuver in a marina. A full keel provides
  better heavy weather control and leads to more comfortable motion. A long-chord
  fin keel is a compromise between the two.

Rudder
: A skeg-hung rudder is protected from underwater collision damage and
  stronger under high loads than a spade rudder. A twin rudder
  provides better steerage and can help prevent broaching when
  heeling, and may be more efficient.  Twin rudders are harder to
  maneuver backwards under power when docking.
  
Rig
: Sloop rigs are the default today. Solent rigs are sloops with multiple
  forestays close together, to allow changing sails by furling and unfurling
  instead of going forward to the bow. They have the drawback that only
  the innermost sail can be tacked; the others have to be furled for each
  tack! A cutter rig has an inset forestay to avoid the tacking problem,
  and even allows multiple headsails to be flown together. They are beautiful and
  can be very effective, but are compromised for smaller boats (forcing a very small
  stormsail and extra bracing in the V berth) and often require running backstays
  for larger boats. Ketches and yawls are almost impossible to find in production
  today. They are great for shorthanded and heavy weather cruising, but require
  more work to sail than a sloop and double the mainsail maintenance costs.

![The Garcia 45 is ready to take you from tropical diving to dodging icebergs.](garcia45.jpg)

There are other derived metrics that help track boat motion and
performance, such as S#, Ballast/Displacement, and
Displacement/Length. I find that the SA/D, Comfort, and Capsize
tend to capture most of this at a high level when comparing across
a large number of boats.

Consider the numbers reported to have large error bars for three
reasons.  First, they vary for a given boat across exact models and
are measured differently by different manufacturers. Second, they are
reported differently across source sites. <!-- I've linked to the source in
each case. Where there is no source, I computed the value from the
other numbers.  -->

Third and most important, the numbers don't exactly correspond to the
properties of the boat. For example, a boat with a longer waterline
should have a higher hull speed. However, that waterline varies with
how the boat is loaded and how much it is heeling, and its impact on
hullspeed is affected by the bow and stern profiles. The derived
quantities such as "comfort ratio" (which is itself a highly
controversial metric) and "capsize screening formula" help compare
similar boats with significant differences in those values,
but are not comparable across radically different types of boats
and they are no so accurate that a few percent difference actually
indicates an advantage.

You may notice that I favored boats that are currently in
production. There are also large number of 1970s and 1980s cruisers
available, but any given boat is hard to find and likely highly
modified from its original specification, so listing many of them
would not be useful. Given some sense of the space of cruisers from
this list, you could then compare those classic (and usually 10-30x
more affordable!) cruisers to them.

I also favor recent designs because there were some radical advances
in cruisers around 2000 and then around 2018. New materials and
computer simulation and modeling enabled great improvements in 
safety (...or cost; vendors made different tradeoffs), features, and
usable interior volume. Unfortunately, the market also shifted
towards larger, luxury boats and charter boats. The sweet spot of 30'
to 40' shorthanded cruisers is not as populated as it once was and 
boats are quickly getting larger and more expensive.

Everything about boat design is a tradeoff between performance, cost,
safety, crew required, manueverability in port, maintainability, and
so on. A boat that is OK at everything excels at noThing. A boat that
is very fast is probably uncomfortable in heavy seas and impractical
for extended cruising. A hardcore bluewater cruiser is likely
overbuilt and compromised for weekend trips and daysailing.
