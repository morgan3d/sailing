                      **Selected Double-Handed Racing Dinghies**
                    Published 2023-01-22; Last updated 2023-01-22

This article compares the most popular and fastest double-handed,
monohull racing dinghy sailboats. All are drysailed and necessarily
have centerboards, daggerboards, or lifting keels. I excluded boats
that _can_ be sailed double-handed but are typically solo (e.g.,
Topaz) or triple (e.g., Thistle) crew. These boats are often raced
in one-design classes, but are also suitable for mixed-class racing.

The 420 is by far the most popular dual-handed dinghy and this list
could be titled "alternatives to the 420", which is definitely the
default boat for clubs, schools, and individuals. 

The 49er remains the gold standard for one-design ocean dinghy racing
by experienced sailors. The relatively new RS Feva is a good and
simple introductory boat for double handed racing in any
environment. Between the Feva and the 49er is a large range within
which sailors of any ability and location can find the best sailboat
for them.

The table is sorted by decreasing Portsmouth Number, so from slowest
to fastest. The fastest boat on paper is not always the best boat. For example, a
49er is too much boat for a small lake or river. It won't be able to
leverage its speed because each leg is too short. In that situation,
it will be a hassle continually tacking and won't have a long enough
downwind run to justify raising the spinnaker.

The boats towards the bottom of the table are generally extreme. They
need an experienced pair of sailors who practice together regularly to
get the most out of the boat. They also can take significantly longer
to rig each day for sailing or for trailering and are relatively
expensive to maintain.

The best boat is suited to the wind, waves, and obstructions in its
local area, to the ability of its crew, and to the other boats it will
sail with.  These boats are all intended for racing. It is not fun to
have the fastest or slowest boat in a region for mixed class racing,
as the excitement of racing is executing the right tactics within the
pack. The ideal case is a large fleet of one-design boats to sail
with, but the more common case is a set of nearby boats with similar
capabilities to compare against.

# Metrics

## Portsmouth Yardstick (PY)

Royal Yacht Association UK handicap, where corrected race time ($C$) is related
to elapsed time ($T$) by:

$C = T \times \dfrac{1000}{\operatorname{PY}}$

Lower numbers thus indicate faster boats. Once a faster boat has finished,
a slower boat will still win if it finishes within $\Delta T$ clock time:

$\Delta T < T_f \times \left(\dfrac{\operatorname{PY}_s}{\operatorname{PY}_f} - 1\right)$

For example, if an RS 800 finishes at $T_f=20$ min elapsed time, a
Wayfarer behind it still has $20 \times (1101/799 - 1)$ min = 7 minutes and
33 seconds to finish and win.

These handicaps are adjusted locally and annually based on reported
results from participating clubs. This causes them to automatically
calibrate to all relevant factors and real-world conditions, unlike
measurement based handicaps.

However, boats with faster designs are usually raced by more
experienced sailors. This means that high rating boats sailed by less
experienced sailors underestimate the performance of the boat itself,
since the ability of those sailors may be limiting the race
performance.

The PY is not adjusted for wind and sea conditions. It is reasonably
accurate for popular boats in 7-12 kts of wind, but may be a poor
handicap in other conditions.

## D-PN

[North American](https://www.ussailing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-North-American-Portsmouth-Yardstick-Handbook.pdf) handicap (this is historically the
"Dixie-Portsmouth Number", but is officially, confusingly called simply "Portsmouth Yardstick", the same as the UK system)
managed by US Sailing, where corrected time is given by:

   $C = T \dfrac{100}{\operatorname{DPN}}$

but the D-PN number is adjusted for the wind conditions in ways that vary
by boat category.

This is related to the PHRF keelboat handicapping system by:

$\operatorname{PHRF} = 6 \times (\operatorname{DPN} - 55)$

The ratings and process are similar to RYA Portsmouth numbers.

The US numbers have not been updated since 2017 and as of 
[2020](https://www.ussailing.org/news/pyonline-qa/) US Sailing
appears to intend to adopt UK Portsmouth numbers.


## First Year

The first year of production. For dinghies, this is really only of
historical interest.  The classes are frequently revised, so a boat
first released in 1946 in a plywood displacement, hiking form may
today be a GRP and carbon fiber planing machine with dual trapezes.

## Trapezes

Is there a trapeze for the crew (1), both crew and helm (2), or
neither? The trapeze allows the sailors to bring their weight further
out, stabilizing the boat. More trapezes leads to a potentially faster, 
and definitely more fun boat. They also require substantially more skill
to sail than a traditional hiking boat and guarantee a very wet ride from spray
plus inevetable capsizes and swimming.

## Spinnaker

A traditional spinnaker adds to downwind sail area, but also complexity
of sailing due to the pole handling and need to raise and lower sail
dynamically.

An asymmetric spinnaker is much easier to raise, douse, and gybe, but
cannot sail as deep as a symmetric one. Asymmetric spinnakers can
sometimes be leveraged all of the way up to a close reach but are slow
below a broad reach.

Asymmetric spinnakers are often deployed on a retracting bowsprit and
are frequently very large compared to traditional spinnakers.

Any spinnaker greatly complicates recovery in the event of a capsize.
They must be dropped while in the water before the boat can come back
up safely.

## Length Overall (LOA)

This is with the bow sprit retracted. Unlike a keelboat, the waterline
of these dinghies is irrelevant for performance as they all plane in
10 kts of wind.  The LOA does not matter much for cost and the crew
will always be on the rail or trapeze pressed against the helmsperson,
so space inside the boat is also not relevant.

LOA mostly matters for racing dinghies for the very practical issue of
whether it will fit in your garage in the winter.

## Beam

Width of the boat, with racks and wings extended. Wider boats generally
offer better performance and hiking/trapezing, but are more difficult
to right after a capsize. 

Beam does not matter much for storage. Double handed boats can't be
transported by car top anyway, and all can be collapsed for trailering
on normal roads. The length will be the limiter on the dock and in 
winter storage.

## Hull Weight

Light boats accelerate quickly, and there is roughly a 3&times; difference
between the heaviest and lightest boats on this list. Light boats can be
difficult to tack in very strong wind, although with a jib all of these boats
tack easily in most conditions.

Heavier boats are more stable, easier to board in high wind, and much
harder to dolly up and down a beach or pull onto a dock. Two small
teens may be unable to beach launch a Wayfarer by themselves, but they
may also be unable to keep a 29er upright while sailing.

## Downwind Sail Area

Sail area including the spinnaker. More area is usually faster,
although many factors affect boat speed. Too much sail area for the
conditions and weight of the crew makes the boat _slower_ and hard to
handle.

## Upwind SA/D

Sail area to displacement ratio. Higher is faster. _All_ of these
boats have ratios that are more than twice typical fast keelboat ratios.
Note that the handicaps track the SA/D ratios closely; this is a very
good predictor of upwind performance.

The sail area and displacement numbers can be measured in various ways, 
though, so the numbers aren't perfectly comparable between boats.
