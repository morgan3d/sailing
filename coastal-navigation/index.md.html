                **Coastal Navigation Case Study**
              Published 2024-08-11; Last updated 2024-08-11

I recently began skippering for short coastal trips around Vancouver
Island in Canada. This article describes how I plan a trip in that
area during the summer, which has mild weather. The area involves 4m
tides creating up to 10 kts of current, so that dominates planning
more than it would in areas such as the Carribean that do not have
signficant tides. 

All of the Sailing Codex is "here's what I do, but use at your own
risk and I'm not saying this is a good practice for you."  That goes
even more so for this article.  While the practices I describe are
based on plenty of formal training and hands-on experience as crew, I
have only a few weeks of actual practice as captain in this region.


Information Required
=====================================================================

Charts
: The foremost factor in navigation is of course staying in legally
  traversable water of sufficient depth and free of obstructions.  An
  up-to-date chart. The Navionics app (which updates charts monthly),
  backed by government paper charts (which update with varying
  frequency).  OpenCPN and chart plotters are great if you update them
  frequently with new charts...which are often produced by Navionics.
  It is really important to have up to date charts for coastal
  navigation.  While a land mass is obviously not going to move in a
  decade, in that period depths, ferry routes, shipping channels, land
  reference marks, compass declination, bridge heights, and buoy
  locations may indeed change significantly.

Wind
: PredictWind, WindFinder, Windy, GRIB files, and Weather VHF
  channels. Land-based forecasts are not usually relevant.
  
Waves
: Marine forecasts that give wind data typically include wave heights,
  but expect high variation in accuracy.  You may be able to predict
  from the wind and some local knowledge better than a broad-area
  forecast. Waves generally lag the wind. For example, a steady 15 kts
  over a large period of time will create waves in the direction of
  the wind for hours afterwards. Rain tends to reduce waves. Wind
  against current creates larger waves. Islands and reefs break up
  waves, as does the lee of any land mass.

Commercial Traffic 
: Charts show channels for large ships and approximate routes
  for ferries. Real-time data on positions and destinations 
  is available over AIS. If you don't have AIS on your plotter but do
  have internet access, use the Marine Traffic website/app. Monitor
  VHF 16 for Securite messages to know when they are traversing
  passes (or about to emerge from them), and regional VHF channels
  for harbormaster

Currents
: Affects speed. Current tables, Navionics and OpenCPN, and regional apps such as PNW
  Current Atlas and OceanConnect. If you don't have access to current
  forecasts, you can estimate from the change in tides. However,
  beware that the currents may be in advance of tides in areas with
  complex bathyography.
  
Tides
: Affects planning to know where you'll have clearance in shallow
  areas, and needed for judging where is safe in an anchorage
  and how much scope will be needed.


Process
=====================================================================

Choose a destination on a chart or map!

Research the destination in your local pilot guide, which for me is
the SalishSeaPilot. It will help you choose suitable moorage, plan
on-shore activities, and provide important local knowledge.

On a nautical chart, coarsely estimate the distance. I do this in
Navionics and OpenCPN. Based on the distance and how far and fast you
expect to travel on average, figure out how many days the trip will
take.  I plan to sail at most 8 hours per day at 5 kts.

Pick out some likely places to stop at the end of each day as well as
some fallbacks if you don't make it as far as you thought. Look
_those_ up in the pilot guide to ensure they are appropriate.

Plot a rough course on any chart program, and then evaluate the
currents at the times you'll be on different legs of the trip.  I use
PNW Current Atlas to get a sense of the current strength and direction
everywhere, and then Navionics or OpenCPN to get actual speeds at tide
stations.

If the course traverses any narrows or passes, I assume I have to hit
those near slack current. Ideally a _high_ slack for the best
maneuverability. Depending on the pass, a small amount of current in
the direction I'm going might be helpful, but I'll still
conservatively have to plan to arrive in time for slack to be safe.

Look at the expected wind strength and direction. The forecasts can
vary highly in different models, so bracket by looking at several
models and then either considering the best and worst case for your
trip or applying your own experience on how those models map to real
local conditions. I use PredictWind, WindFinder, Windy, and
OceanConnect apps.

Based on the current and wind, revise your estimate for how fast
you'll be traveling on each leg. Then use those speeds to revise your
expected stopping points. Iterate until you have a reasonable expected
plan. My crew and I like to take our time for cruising; the journey is
the point more than the destination. So, I assume I'm not setting out
each day until after brunch, and the I'm moored for the night at least
two hours before sunset to make dinner.

Sometimes the current is not favorable and it is impractical to
significantly alter the timing of a leg. In this case, choose routes
through wider passages and stay in shallower areas may to minimize
the effects of the current.
   
Make fallback plans with distinct triggering event. For example, I'll
note "if it is later than 5pm when we pass Ganges, abort the rest of
that leg and anchor in Long Harbour or James Bay for the night,
whichever is more sheltered."

Waves affect comfort, safety, and performace. Choose anchorages that
will be protected from the prevailing waves as well as wind.  This is
usually the same direction, but if here is a significant wind change
or unusual geographic features they may differ. Assume that following
waves will slightly increase speed and bashing into oncoming waves may
significantly decrease speed. Avoid taking large waves on the beam,
where they will roll the boat more. For coastal cruising, avoid
sailing altogether if there will be very large waves and just wait for
a better weather window. Some areas, such as the Southern Gulf Islands,
San Francisco Bay, and Virgin Islands have relatively little waves
even in moderate wind because local geography breaks them up.

Once the trip is planned, make a route in your navigation software.  I
use Navionics on a tablet, which I can conveniently carry everywhere
in the boat. You might also use your chart plotter or OpenCPN on a
laptop. Set the waypoints, paying attention to what the actual depths
will be, avoiding shipping channels and ferry routes (or at least
crossing them at right angles), and staying out of the lee of
islands. 

In mild conditions, I try to set my waypoints to sail in shallow
depths closer to a leeward shore than the channel. There I have good
wind but I don't have to deal with ferries and other large boats. As
the wind or waves build I want to instead be closer to a windward
shore where it is more protected and I have sea room.

Finally, write down an abbreviated tide table for each area. I record
the times at which the tide will hit -1m, -0.5m, 0m, +0.5m, +1m, +2m,
+3m, and +4m relative to the chart datum (skipping extremes that
aren't happening that day). It is easier for me to interpolate from
the times at simple heights than to write down the tide at every
time. Make a note of the times of slack at which the current reverses
(which is confusingly not always exactly at high and low die).

I prefer to moor (anchor, mooring ball, or dock) and depart on a
rising tide.  That way, if I get stuck on something I will quickly be
freed instead of waiting hours--which in the Salish Sea can be 24
hours.

I have a simple anchoring worksheet I use to avoid any confusion or
arithmetic errors when anchoring. I mentally or on paper run a draft
version of that for any anchorage before I set sail as a quick check
of my plan.

This entire process is very iterative. There are too many variables,
including the goals and schedules of the crew, to plan it all in one
try.  So, I make a plan, iterate on the plan, get agreement and then
make some backup plans, and then stay flexible as we go. For
recreational coastal cruising I much prefer to have a careful plan
that we'll discard at a whim instead of either no plan or a plan we
have to rigorously follow.
