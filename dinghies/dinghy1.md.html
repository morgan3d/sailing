This article compares the most popular and fastest single-handed,
monohull racing dinghy sailboats. These boats are often raced in
one-design classes, but are also suitable for mixed-class racing. All
are drysailed and necessarily have centerboards, daggerboards, or
lifting keels. I excluded boats that _can_ be sailed solo but are
typically double-handed, such as the Laser Vago.

The Laser (ILCA) is by far the most popular single-handed dinghy. It
is the default boat choice for clubs, schools, and
individuals. They've been a mainstay of Olympic sailing and have the
great practical benefit that complete used boats and new parts are
readily available everywhere in the world. I put in 20 years racing
Lasers, myself.

However, the Laser design is frozen in the 1970s and is now at the
middle of the single-handed performance range. I personally like the
RS Aero as a Laser-like boat with significantly reduced mass, a high
boom, and a mainsheet that won't catch on every gybe. I've raced that boat
for the last ten years. The D-Zero is very similar but hard to obtain.

For decades, the gold standard for single-handed speed has been the
foiling International Moth. However, it isn't for everyone. It has a
reportedly steep learning curve, and I've rarely seen one right side up 
for more than a few minutes in a row in a race. For one-design racing
without foiling, the RS700 takes it to the max with a spinnaker and
trapeze. 

The Optimist is the default boat of choice for small children
and can even be constructed at home fairly easily. The O'Pen Skiff is
an emerging challenger. It is more expensive, but self-bailing and
sportier than the Optimist.

The Sunfish remains my all-around favorite beach boat for casual
single-handing. It rigs in _seconds_, has no controls to fiddle with,
and for a dinghy is extremely stable. Despite the 1229 PN handicap,
I wouldn't expect one to race in a mixed class fleet.

The table below is sorted by decreasing RYA Portsmouth Yardstick
Number, so from slowest at the top to fastest at the bottom.  The
fastest boat is not always the _best_ boat for a given area and
typical conditions. Usually the best boat for a sailor is one that
fits their budget and is similar to what their neighbors are in.

# Metrics

## Portsmouth Yardstick (PY)

Royal Yacht Association UK handicap, where corrected race time ($CT$) is related
to elapsed time ($ET$) by:

$CT = ET \times \dfrac{1000}{\operatorname{PY}}$

Lower numbers thus indicate faster boats. Once a faster boat has finished,
a slower boat will still win if it finishes within $\Delta ET$ clock time:

$\Delta ET < ET_f \times \left(\dfrac{\operatorname{PY}_s}{\operatorname{PY}_f} - 1\right)$

For example, a Laser has 1m 48s to finish to still beat an RS Aero 9
that finished a race in 20 minutes elapsed time: 108s = 20 min &times; (1101 / 1010 - 1).

These handicaps are adjusted locally and annually based on reported
results from participating clubs. This causes them to automatically
calibrate to all relevant factors and real-world conditions, unlike
measurement based handicaps.

However, boats with faster designs are usually raced by more
experienced sailors. This means that high rating boats sailed by less
experienced sailors underestimate the performance of the boat itself,
since the ability of those sailors may be limiting the race
performance.

Unlike D-PN, the PN is not adjusted for wind and sea conditions. It is
reasonably accurate for popular boats in 7-12 kts of wind, but may be
a poor handicap in other conditions.


The deprecated [North American Dixie-Portsmouth Number](https://www.ussailing.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-North-American-Portsmouth-Yardstick-Handbook.pdf) handicap 
is managed by US Sailing. Corrected time is given by:

   $CT = ET \dfrac{F}{\operatorname{DPN}}$
   
where $F$ can be any number chosen constant by the committee over a
series.  One common values is $F=100$, which is an easy round number.
Another is $F=83$, because the D-PN system uses the Thistle class as a
fixed baseline of $DPN=83$. The common ILCA 7 ("Laser Standard") boat
has an average handicap of $DPN=83$, so choosing $F=83$ gives
corrected times that are close to elapsed times.

The D-PN number for a class is adjusted up to 5% for the wind
conditions in ways that by boat category. For most dinghy classes, the
handicap grows more advantageous in light winds but in ways that
differ between dinghies That is, the boats are expected to perform
worse than proportionally in light wind, but some boats are really
slow in light wind because they then can't plane or leverage their
trapezes.

This is related to the PHRF keelboat handicapping system by:

$\operatorname{PHRF} = 6 \times (\operatorname{DPN} - 55)$

The ratings and process are broadly similar to RYA Portsmouth numbers.

The US Sailing D-PN numbers have not been updated since 2017 and as of 
[2020](https://www.ussailing.org/news/pyonline-qa/) US Sailing
adopted the RYA Portsmouth numbers.

## First Year

The first year of production. For dinghies, this is really only of
historical interest. The classes are frequently revised, so a boat
first released in 1946 in a plywood displacement, hiking form may
today be a GRP and carbon fiber planing machine with dual trapezes.

## Length Overall (LOA)

Length of the boat, with the bowsprit retracted for the few that have
them. Unlike a keelboat, the waterline of these dinghies is
irrelevant for performance as they all plane in 10 kts of wind.

LOA mostly matters for racing dinghies for the very practical issue of
whether it will fit in your garage in the winter and on your cartop
or trailer during the season.

## Beam

Width of the boat. Wider boats generally offer better performance and
can be more stable, but are more difficult to right after a
capsize. For a single-handed boat, the beam also determines whether
you can get it inside your basement/cellar door for winter storage.

![The Optimist is a gentle introduction to sailing for kids that is backed by a competitive international racing class.](opti.jpg attrib="©Matias Capizzano, via Optimist Class Association" attriburl="https://www.optiworld.org/default/multimedia/photogallery/col/36483")

## Weight

Light boats accelerate quickly, but can be difficult to tack or
recover from capsize in very strong wind. I find the RS Aero
challenging to tack above 17 kts of wind with the large 9m^2 sail, and
difficult to recover after 22 kts.

A light boat is also much easier to put on a trailer or car top by
oneself.

The specifications for the boats are inconsistent. For some, the
"weight" listed is the mass of the hull, which is interesting when you
have to lift it. For others, the number given is the displacement in
full sailing trim, which is indicative of acceleration potential.

## Upwind Sail Area

Sail area, excluding the spinnaker or jib for the few that have them.
More area is usually faster, although many factors affect boat
speed. Too much sail area for the conditions and weight of the sailor
makes the boat _slower_ and hard to handle.

It is relatively easy to modify the rig for a single-handed dinghy, as
the rig is often unstayed and there is not a lot of variation in spar
radii between boats. The RS Aero has three interchangeable production
rigs for different conditions. Many sailors will swap out modern
carbon spars and oversized sails for light air sailing in older hulls,
breathing new performance into classic designs.

## Upwind SA/D

(Curved) sail area to displacement ratio. Higher is faster. _All_ of these
boats have ratios that are more than twice typical fast keelboat ratios.
Note that the handicaps track the SA/D ratios closely; this is a very
good predictor of upwind performance.

The sail area and displacement numbers can be measured in various ways, 
though, so the numbers aren't perfectly comparable between boats.

\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\mbox{"SA/D"} &=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\mbox{ft}^2]}{\left(\mbox{displacement} ~ [\mbox{ft}^3]\right)^{2/3}} \\
\nonumber\\
\nonumber
&=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\operatorname{ft}^2]}{\left(\frac{1}{64} \mbox{displacement}~[\operatorname{lbs}]\right)^{2/3}} \\
\nonumber\\
\nonumber
&=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\mbox{m}^2]}{\left(\frac{1}{1006}\mbox{displacement}~[\mbox{kg}]\right)^{2/3}} \\
\nonumber\\
\nonumber
&=& \dfrac{\mbox{sail area} ~ [\mbox{m}^2]}{\left(\mbox{displacement}~[\mbox{m}^3]\right)^{2/3}}
\end{eqnarray}
