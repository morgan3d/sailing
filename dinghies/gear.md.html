                      **Dinghy Sailing Gear**
                       Updated 2023-06-11

This article recommends categories of *gear* (technical clothing) for
dinghy sailing.  In modern sailing terminology, a "dinghy" is a small
sailboat. They typically have a centerboard or daggerboard instead of
a fixed keel, have a crew of 1-3 people, and are daysailed and
[drysailed](../drysail.md.html). Dinghies are also often high
performance and used for racing, easily moving twice as fast as many
keelboats due to their light weight and planing abilities.

See also the comparison guide for one-design
[single-handed](dinghy1.md.html) and [double-handed](dinghy2.md.html)
racing dinghies.

General
====================================================================

The basic sailing outfit is:

1. *PFD*, with the pocketa containing:
  1. Marine whistle
  2. Small bit of strong line for on-the-water repairs
  3. Optional Clif bar or other flat, waterproof snack
2. *Wetsuit*, or swim trunks or tights and a rashguard top
3. *Dinghy boots* (aka hiking boots)
4. Polarized *sunglasses* with a retaining strap
5. *Hat*: winter skullcap, summer wide brim hat, summer baseball cap, or watersports helmet
6. Sailing *gloves*
7. *Harness* if sailing with a trapeze
8. Optional spandex *pinnie* (aka racing vest)
9. Plastic or metal *water bottle* with a retaining loop
10. *Neck gaiter* (aka scarf)
12. Optional *spray top* or fleece pullover
13. *Watch* with countdown timer and optional GPS

In suitable conditions, this might scale down to wearing only a PFD,
swim trunks, and sunglasses on a Sunfish for a short lake jaunt. It
might also scale up to a full drysuit for frostbiting in the winter.

PFD
====================================================================

Any PFD that suits your weight and fits well is a good start. You will
be most comfortable if you can afford to buy a sailing-specific, [Type
III](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/CG-ENG-4/PFDSel/), vest-style PFD.

Inflatable (Type V) PFDs are not good for dinghies. Those are for
offshore sailing in keelboats. In a dinghy, you're going to be in the
water a lot and can't use a single-charge autoinflating PFD.

Type I PFDs are uncomfortable for dinghies and generally more than you
need. Those are designed to support the head in the water and to be
worn on large boats in emergency situations. In a dinghy, you are
likely to be conscious when capsized, so don't need the extra
support. You do need more freedom of movement.

Kayaking and fishing-style Type III PFDs sit high on the chest
and have a lot of pockets. They're designed to clear seat
backs and for a more upright or hunched forward seating position.
For sailing, there is no seat back and it is better to have long,
thin foam panels with no pockets instead of thick ones with
lots of things to catch lines on.

Small children are a special case. For them, head support is
important, as are a crotch strap and a handle on the back so that you
can pull them out of the water easily.

A PFD only helps if you are wearing it. Always wear your PFD in a
small boat. Ensure that it is in good condition, rated for your
activity and weight, and zipped or buckled and fits snugly, so that it
won't ride up when you're in the water.


Wetsuit
====================================================================

Wetsuits are neoprene body suits designed to prevent hypothermia.
They do not prevent water ingress. Instead, they allow water in but
minimize the flow of water, so that the body can heat up the water
adjacent to the skin. You will not be warm when first immersed, but
will be safe if wearing a suitably thick wetsuit.

When racing, I prefer a wetsuit to swim trunks even in the summer. It
avoids the need for sunscreen on my arms and legs and protects against
minor bumps and rope burns. It adds a bit of buoyancy; in a thick wetsuit
I need almost no effort to float even without a PFD, although I of course
always wear a PFD in a small boat. A wetsuit makes my whole body smooth, reducing
the chance of clothing catching in a block or on a fitting (as well as
being a bit visually slimming!) and adds a bit of comfort when
sitting on the gunnel for hours. 

I don't personally sail dinghies any more when the water is below 10
degrees C (50 degrees F), but down to that temperature I still prefer
a wetsuit to a drysuit. Drysuits are much more comfortable, but also
bulky in a small boat, and if they tear then their thermal protection
is completely compromised. A wetsuit with a tear is almost as
effective as a perfect wetsuit. When I used to sail in colder
water, below 10 degrees C was definitely drysuit weather.

Sailing and kayak wetsuits are reinforced in the seat and knees in
ways that increases longetivity. Surfing and diving wetsuits can be
worn when sailing but may wear out sooner.


Fit
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To operate correctly, a wetsuit must be tight, especially at the holes
for hands, feet, and head. Neoprene expands a little when wet, so a
properly fitting wetsuit is almost uncomfortably tight when first
tried on dry in a shop. 

The neck gasket and arm gaskets are sometimes rubber and do not expand
when wet, so if it feels like you are choking when you put it on, that
tightness is not going to go away. However, you might find that once
you get out on the water you do not notice it very much.

(Tip: I _also_ wear my sailing wetsuit when swimming or canoeing in cold
water. The Great Lakes and Pacific ocean are usually too cold for my
particular comfort level in a swimsuit but feel nice in a
wetsuit!)


Thickness
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wetsuits are specified in millimeters of neoprene. The primary role of
the wetsuit is to protect the wearer from cold water, so thicker
wetsuits are better in colder water. A summer wetsuit may be as thin
as 0.5 mm. A winter one may be as thick as 6 mm. Some have additional
materials such as thin fleece on the inside that can increase comfort
and thermal protection.

The air temperature also matters. Early in the spring, the air may be
warm but the water will still be cold. You might be hot while sailing,
but still need a relatively thick wetsuit for when you capsize. One
solution is to choose based on the water temperature--and then go for
a swim when you get too hot! Seriously, in high air temperatures, pay
attention to your body heat when wearing a wetsuit if you are out of
the water.  Your sweat can't evaporate, so you have to intentionally
get wet (and drink a lot of fluids, and avoid direct sun when
possible) to stay cool. In a summer heat wave, I'll often jump in and
float beside my boat between races to stay cool and out of the sun
instead of just sitting there waiting for the next sequence.

General wetsuit temperature guides are not particularly useful for
dinghy sailors. Unlike a diver or surfer, you are going to be out of
the water most of the time. Unlike a paddler, your legs will be moving
a lot more, so you're getting good circulation and also not sitting in
a puddle. The thickness of wetsuit that you need will also vary with
the air temperature, amount of wind, your metabolism and body fat
percentage, what you're wearing on your head, hands, and feet, and
what temperature range you can tolerate.

For your first wetsuit, you might start at 3 mm and then add more
suits to your collection that are thicker, thinner, or have different
pieces as you get more experience wearing it throughout the year.


Pieces
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wetsuits pieces come in different cuts:

Full suit
: The default full body suit, great for cold weather (and swimming),
  and with good sun coverage.
  
Farmer John
: Like overalls: full leg and chest coverage, but armless and often
  with a deep neck cutout. Good for keeping cool on hot days because
  the underarms and neck are more exposed, and relatively comfortable
  because only the ankles are restricted by gaskets.  This can be
  paired with a neoprene top, rashguard, or spray top. Not useful for
  long periods of immersion or swimming because water will flow in the
  top fairly quickly.

Shorty
: Short arms and legs, with uninterrupted torso coverage. These are a good
  alternative to a Farmer John for warm days when swimming or full
  immersion is expected. They don't provide knee protection when kneeling
  in light wind. The gaskets keep cold water from getting in.

Springsuit
: Typically long arms and short legs, maybe with no leg
  coverage at all past the crotch. I've never seen anyone sail in
  these.
  
Tights
: For really warm days, thin neoprene tights keep the lower body
  warm when immersed and can be paired with a rashguard or other top.
  They tend to slip down in the back due to the constant sitting and
  hiking motions, so look for a pair with a strong or high waistband
  and tuck your top into them to avoid getting lower back sunburn.

Top
: A tight neoprene shirt goes well over a Farmer John or could be worn
  with swim trunks. Keeping the chest warm is probably more important
  than the lower body and the upper body also has more risk of sun exposure.
  I personally always wear mine with a Farmer John, though. I don't like
  my lower body being cold, and that's the part in the water when launching
  a dinghy!
  
Socks
: Neoprene socks go well under dinghy boots. They help with fit, make it
  easier to get the boots off when wet, and keep feet much warmer. 
  The downside is that the socks will ensure that your feet are _always_
  wet, since they prevent water from running out as well as in and remain
  damp. I just dry my feet very well afterwards and sometimes moisturize
  them to replace the skin oil lost.



Getting Dressed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Avoid using fingernails to pull on a wetsuit, as it can tear, and be
careful with strong forces on the seams. Try to slide your limbs into
partly rolled bits of the suit instead of stretching it. 

Do not pull the zipper under tension. For a back zipper, scrunch your
shoulders together and have someone else pull the zipper up if possible.
For a front zipper, bring your shoulders in and hunch forward while
zipping.

It is hard to get straight information about what people wear under
wetsuits, and even anonymous forum posts are rather coy. From what
I've observed in practice, most sailors wear nothing under their
wetsuit. One could wear a form-fitting swimsuit or underwear, but it
would likely be uncomfortable and probably print obvious lines through
the suit. However, under thin wetsuit tights and a rashguard, a
bikini/bikini brief style swimsuit can provide more support for those
who need it.


Urination
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another wetsuit topic folks are reticent to discuss is peeing. Here's
the truth.  Most dinghy sailors jump in the water and then urinate
through their suit. (This is one reason that you probably don't want a
rental or used wetsuit.)

In a shortie or tights it is easy to get some water flow through the
suit to flush this out immediately. In a full suit with a front
zipper, it is also easy to get a cleansing flow, although may require
two hands. For a full suit with a back zipper...sorry, you don't have
any good options. Swim a bit longer afterwards.

Wash your suit well at home. There are several
[products and practices](https://www.scubadivingearth.com/how-to-clean-smelly-wetsuits-including-urine-smell/)
specifically for treating wetsuits made with awareness of this
practice. 

I know that by land standards this is gross, but you're an athlete and
this is just how bodies work. Being pragmatic and staying hydrated is
far preferable to heat stroke, dehydration, or kidney stones from not 
drinking and peeing. 

(If you still are squeamish, then consider that this is nothing by
sailor standards, let alone anyone who's raised a baby. Peeing in the
ocean in a wetsuit is far preferable to the washrooms in nearly every
Caribbean beach bar I've visited. Cruisers have to empty holding tanks
filled with weeks of sewage. This practice doesn't even rate as mildly
distasteful in comparison.)


Helmet
=======================================================================

Helmets made specifically for water sports can be worn for sailing as
head protection. Unlike land helmets, these have closed-cell foam to
remain watertight, are relatively thin and sleek, and may have a sun
visor. These may be marketed as surf, waterskiing, or whitewater kayaking, as well as sailing 
helmets. [Gath](https://gathsports.com/), [Forward](https://www.forward-wip.com/type-de-produit/helmets/),
[Predator](https://www.predatorhelmets.com/collections/water) and [Zhik](https://www.zhik.com/)
are four major manufacturers.

The
[research and policy](https://www.sailingworld.com/concussion-free-sailing/)
on sailing helmets for small boats is currently inconclusive and inconsistent. There
is no question that helmets protect the head. Head injuries
including concussions are a significant risk in sailing from the
boom's movement during a tack or gybe, standing up under the boom, and
being struck by another vessel when in the water. There's also a
possibility of being struck by _another_ boat's boom, a capsizing
mast, or a falling or carried mast when rigging, but these have low
chances relative to the other cases.

However, it is also the case that a sailing helmet reduces your
situational awareness and increases the clearance required under the
boom. This means that you might be _more_ likely to strike your head
when wearing a helmet, although less likely to sustain injury. They
also can be warm in the summer and not warm enough in the winter.

Personally, I sailed most of my life without a helmet, but for the
past several I've _always_ worn a helmet when sailing a high
performance dinghy. This includes on hot, light wind days when
training and not even racing. The risk of any head injury just isn't
worth increasing for a small amount of comfort for me.

In 25 years of racing dinghies, I've fortunately never been hit by
another boat and only been seriously struck twice by a boom. Yet, I'd
give anything to have not had those injuries and the concussions they
produced. I have lightly tapped the top or back of my head on a boom
many times, especially when racing in an unfamiliar boat with low
clearance or when suddenly jumping to the rail mid-gybe at a mark if
hit with a gust or wave. Before wearing a helmet, those taps
guaranteed a headache for the rest of the day and sometimes a
lump. Now they are just a mildly embarrassing rebuke.

I favor PFD, hat, and helmet colors that are easily visible in the
water, especially yellow and white. Red, blue, and black might be hard
to see in waves or rain on an overcast day. Generally, nobody is
coming to "rescue" you in a dinghy capsize as with a crew-overboard
sitation on a keelboat.  So, in a dinghy what I am most concerned
about with color is alerting other nearby boats that I'm in the
water. There's a risk of being struck by a powerboat or jetski coming
to "help" when they see a capsized dinghy, or by another sailboat
during a race.


Gloves
=======================================================================

There are no sailing gloves that will keep your hands warm and prevent
chafe while also giving you good control over lines and the ability to
tie knots. You have to choose for the given conditions and goals what is
more important.

The material choice is neoprene (warmer) versus leather (more chafe
resistant) versus various kinds of cloth (more flexible and
comfortable). On larger boats, I also wear fleece and wool mittens in
the winter, which _are_ warm, but on a dinghy this isn't practical.

You'll want your thumb and index finger free for feeling the lines
and tiller, and for tying and untying knots when rigging or repairing
on the water. The other fingers may be full fingered or also cut off.
I find that the most wear when single-handing is on my pinkie and that
end of the palm from the mainsheet, so I prefer a glove that has a high
or full pinkie finger.

For sailing with a spinnaker, I like good palm coverage with leather.
Halyard and sheets for the spinnaker will run through the hand much more
than jibsheets and mainsheets and are more likely to cause rope burn.

work gloves with the sprayed on rubber palms, and cuts the index and
thumb off. He says this gives him a good compromise of protection and
flexibility.


Footwear
=======================================================================



Watch/Instruments
=======================================================================

There are no instruments on a dinghy, so any information that you need
is going to come from something that you bring with you. A wristwatch
is very helpful for ensuring that you aren't late for dinner, and is
essential for knowing when previously-researched tides and currents or
expected weather systems will change.

A watch with a countdown timer is essential for racing. Keep it set to
five minutes and tap when the start sequence begins.

A GPS watch can give you current speed over ground and a recorded
track for later study and logging. This is very helpful for self
coaching. Dedicated
[Velocitek Speedpuck](https://www.velocitek.com/pages/speedpuck) or
[Raymarine Tacktick Compass](https://www.raymarine.com/en-us/our-products/marine-instruments/racing-instruments/t060-micro-compass)
will perform this function as well, and are temporarily attached to
the boat itself.  I use these, but wish I'd bought a GPS watch
instead. The watch is easier to see when wearing sunglasses, doesn't
require a mount on each boat you get in, and can be used on land as
well.

Fitness watches that monitor heart rate and other properties can help
for overall training and condition when sailing.
