                       **Dinghy Launch and Retrieval**
                            Updated 2023-01-04


Sailing dinghies are typically *dry sailed*, meaning that they are
retrieved from the water after sailing.

The typical storage situations are:

- On a dolly (a hand trailer)
- Pulled out of the water onto a dock
- Pulled onto a beach or lawn
- Carried from a car or trailer

Launching from a dolly is generally the easiest and best to avoid
damaging the boat's hull, and doing so from a protected beach
is the preferred case.

_Launching and landing are the times you are most likely to damage
your boat or become injured. As with all of the notes in this series,
I'm collecting publicly available information here and adding my
experience, but not vouching for the accuracy or applicability of any
of this information for your own sailing. Confirm everything with
other sources, local experts, and your own experimentation._


Launching
========================================================================

Before launching, rig the boat with the centerboard and rudder raised. Leave
the sail controls (vang and sheet) loose. Check all of the rigging. Is
the sail at the top of the mast? Are all of the lines running clear
and free from wear? Are the battens in good shape? Is the main sheet
running through the block the correct way? And so on.

Determine the wind direction and look for signs of how it changes
further out on the water. Look for boat traffic, swimmers,
obstructions in the water, and other factors that will affect your
navigation as and after you launch. Think about how you will later
land before you launch. Consider how the wind and tide may change by
then as well. Do not leave shore before you have a plan for how to
land on return.


Dock Launch
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If launching from a dock, push the boat off the dock into the water
while holding the painter. Turn the bow into the wind. Then, hold the
mast and pull the boat alongside the dock so that it is facing
upwind. If you need a moment to adjust things, sit on the dock with
both feet in the cockpit holding the boat against the dock.
Lower the centerboard and rudder before getting in the boat. 

When ready to launch, hold the main sheet and rudder in one hand. Step
into the boat while forcefully shoving off the dock with your back foot.
Immediately sheet in, lower your head, and steer away from the wind
so that you are close hauled or on a beam reach. Tighten the vang
as you move away from the dock and get settled.


Shore Launch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If launching directly from shore, move the boat into the water with
the bow facing only a few degrees off the wind. Stay on the upwind
side near the bow at all times so that you can control the boat and
are not hit by the boom. In strong wind or any waves, ensure that this
is also the sea side--never stand between a boat and the shore or a
dock.

Get deep enough to drop the centerboard and rudder partway. If using a 
daggerboard, ensure that it is far enough down to allow a tack.

If you have a dolly, quickly run it up the shore far enough that waves
and tide changes will not pull it in. If in waves, this is impossible
to do without a second person. Do not leave a boat unattended in
waves. It will capsize, smash into the bottom/shore, and potentially
injure someone as it sweeps in to shore. A small boat with a wave
behind it is a nearly unstoppable force.

Grab the main sheet and keep just enough tension to prevent the boom
from swinging wildly. Hop in the boat over the gunnel or the
stern. Quickly sheet in and steer off the wind. Drop and secure the
rudder and centerboard as soon as the water is deep enough. Watch for
sudden wind changes of strength or direction that often occur near
shore. Tighten the vang.


After Launching
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as the water is at least shoulder deep, you have maneuvering
room, and are in relatively clear air, execute a tack in each
direction and then a gybe. This ensures that nothing is
tangled. 

Because dinghies are often partly rigged each time they are launched,
this rigging check is needed. Every time you rig is an opportunity to
make a mistake. It is easy to have the rudder on the wrong side of a
traveller or the vang wrapped around the cunningham. If there is a
rigging failure that will prevent you from turning, then it is
important to discover that quickly, while close to shore.

If there is a problem, return to knee deep water and fix it there. You
probably do not need to pull the boat out of the water. In light air,
you may be able to fix simple rigging problems while sailing as
well. Even a halyard jammed at the top of the mast can be corrected by
capsizing and swimming to the masthead, or capsizing in knee-deep
water and walking to it.

It is also important to execute the tack and gybe soon after entering
normal wind conditions to verify your understanding of the wind
direction and strength and sea state. If you have difficulty executing
a tack and gybe, the conditions are to challenging for you to sail
that day. I compare this to testing the brakes on my car when driving
in snow, to verify my stopping distance and traction.

Finally, if you are sailing in an unfamiliar area, look back at shore
and memorize some landmarks so that you can find your landing spot
later.  Consider that cars and other boats may move, flags may be
lowered, and the sun will change before then, so pick landmarks that
will not be affected.


Retrieval
======================================================================

Plan your landing before you launch, and then when returning to shore
review it explicitly. Determine how you will come in, where you will
land, and fallback plans. Fallback plans include what to do if another
boat arrives first, if you miss your desired landing, or if you have a
capsize or equipment failure at the last moment.

If possible, raise the rudder and centerboard partway as you approach
shore. Be prepared to release the vang and mainsheet when it is time 
to depower the boat.

Dock Retrieval
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a choice of landing at a dock or a protected beach without
waves, choose the beach. It gives you more options if there is traffic
or something goes wrong, more choices of landing orientation, and is
not a large, hard object that can damage your boat or body if a wave
pushes you into it.

When landing at a dock, you _must_ come to a stop with the boat facing
upwind. You cannot land downwind or the boat will be swept down the
dock. Do not run straight into the dock; always come alongside it in
whichever direction is facing upwind. If possible, land on the leeward
side of the dock so that the wind is pushing you away from the dock
instead of pinning you to it and sweeping the boom into you.

Release the sheet and vang when the boat is alongside the dock and
scamper out over the gunnel at the widest part of the boat. With
experience you can learn to dock by stepping off your boat directly
onto the dock, holding the mast the entire time. This requires balance
and knowledge of how to steer well by only shifting your weight, so
don't attempt it until you are confident. It is better to slide on
your belly onto a dock like a novice than capsize next to it like an
idiot.

When you exit the boat, hold on to the mast or the painter. If your
boat has a halyard, drop the mainsail as soon as you are on the
dock. Remove the rudder and raise the centerboard completely.  When
the boat is alongside the dock, be careful that it does not slip under
the dock in waves or smash the underside of its gunnels on the top of
the dock. Both of these can quickly damage a boat as well as any
fingers caught between the two objects.

Get the boat out of the water as quickly as possible. While on the
dock in the water you are vulnerable to being hit by another boat
docking and are consuming valuable shared landing space.

To lift the boat out of the water, hold the bow and push the gunnel
away from the dock. The boat should spin so that it is pointing straight
in to the dock. Push _down_ hard on the bow, trying to submerge it,
and then let it pop up. When it starts to fall back down again, push
down again hard. Then, as it rises up again, lift the bow (lifting with
your legs, not your lower back!) as high out of the water as you can and drag
it backwards out of the water. The boat should be pointed about 30 degrees
into the air and sliding against the edge of the dock as it comes out.

When you have pulled back as far as you can, push the bow down flat on
the dock, pivoting around the edge of the dock. Then pull it backwards
held flat. This process avoids you ever having to lift most of the weight 
of the boat. First you are using buoyancy and momentum to help elevate it,
and then the boat's own weight is rotating it down and flat. Once the
boat's wet hull is on the dock it will slide easily enough. 

To protect your boat from nails in the dock, you can use an old carpet
remnant or piece of astroturf. Many dinghy docks have this permanently
attached (by...nails or staples, which you have to be bindful of).


Lake Shore or Protected Beach
------------------------------------------------------------------

A beach with at least partial protection from waves and wind is ideal
for landing a dinghy. You have much more maneuvering room than at a
dock and there is no hard object (except for rocks on the bottom) to
hit and damage your boat. 

As you approach the beach, raise the centerboard and rudder to the
same level as when you launched. If there is current or a strong
cross wind, make sure to aim "above" the point where you want to land
so that you will drift down to it. Ease the vang and prepare to ease
the main.

At a beach you also have about 90 degrees of freedom in the angle at
which you land, versus a dock where you must align upwind with the
dock itself. The ideal scenario is wind blowing along the beach. That
allows you to approach at speed and without heeling on a beam reach,
round up into the wind parallel to the beach to stop, and then step
off on the sea side with the boat fully under control and neither being
blown into the shore or out to sea.

The second best scenario is landing upwind. Tack in towards shore,
point the boat head to wind when in knee deep water, and jump out over
the side, maintaing a handhold. The boat will try to blow back out to
sea if you let go, so be careful when fetching your dolly or use a
long painter. 

The upwind approach can be tricky if the wind is strong because you
will not be able to point very high. Use your pointing techniques:
keep your weight forward in the boat and hike out to make it flat,
keep the centerboard down as long as possible, and tighten the luff
with the cunningham if overpowered. If you must flatten the sail more
because you are severely overpowered and not making headway towards
shore, use the mainsheet first and then the vang. Do not overtighten
the outhaul for flattening or you'll lose all shape and won't be able
to accelerate into the wind.

When you must land downwind, be very careful of an accidental gybe.
The wind often changes near shore and you will also be distracted
looking at the shoreline and down to judge the water depth. Come in a
broad reach if possible to avoid accidental gybes. When you are at the
desired depth, quickly round up into the wind and jump out of the
boat, maintaining a handhold on the side. 

Move to the bow and hold the boat from there. Stay on the sea side and
upwind, just as when launching. If you can drop your mainsail with a
halyard do so, and then raise the centerboard and remove the rudder.

If you have a dolly, quickly retrieve it, keeping an eye on the boat
the whole time. Pull the dolly to the boat (instead of the other way
around) and put the boat on the dolly, keeping the bow into the
wind. You may have to stand on the dolly to intentionally sink it
beneath the boat. Then bring the dolly to shore and pull it up with
the bow pointing towards shore. Go far enough up the shore that you
are safe from the reach of waves and then turn the boat into the wind
before derigging.

When landing in strong wind on a boat with a sock-style main, such as
a Laser, you can release the sail by freeing the main from the
block. This allows the sail to rotate around to the bow, which may be
necessary to control it if landing and retrieving downwind.


Unprotected Beach
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Landing a dinghy on an unprotected beach with large waves is
challenging.

### Sledding

If you don't care much about the condition of your hull, then you can
pull the centerboard and rudder at the last moment and run it straight
onto the beach. Then get out of the boat as soon as it starts to touch
shore to, avoid your weight driving it into the ground even harder.

Even on sand this will scrape up the bottom horribly on a fiberglass
or wooden boat. That's not going to cause structural damage but will
destroy the gel coat or varnish and make your boat slower. On a
rotomolded plastic boat it is probably OK unless landing on
rocks. Some boats are even designed with rowboat-like runners on the
bottom to facilitate beach landings by sledding. I would never land a
racing dinghy this way, but know there are some Laser and Sunfish
sailors who sled their dinghies over sand for every launch and
retrieval with no regrets.

The advantage of this landing method is that you are quickly on shore
and out of the dangerous region where waves break, _and_ it can easily
be executed by a solo sailor. If anything goes wrong with another
strategy or you are injured and unable to execute your preferred landing, 
then this sledding alternative can quickly become attractive.


### Floating Dolly

![<small>Gentle conditions for a shore retrieval on Lake Huron</small>](huron.jpg width=400px) 
If you don't want to scrape your hull on sand and rocks, you'll have
to stop in the water. Do so in the deepest water where you think you
can stand. Ideally this is deeper than where waves are breaking, but
that might not be possible. Follow the general preparation for
landing on a protected beach. If you have a halyard, bring down the
sail as quickly as possible and lash it to the boom. Otherwise, for a
sock style sail release the main from the block so that it can swing
out freely, being careful that the mainsheet is not whipping around.

Always stay on the sea side of the boat. If you lose control, let the
boat capsize and drive into shore, and then quickly drag it up the
beach from shore. Your boat will get damaged, but _you_ won't.  Do not
let the boat sit capsized in breaking waves for any period of time or
the damage could be severe. Never let a person get between the boat
and shore. You cannot stop the incoming motion of even a small dinghy
that is caught capsized in a wave. Once a boat is sideways, it will
no longer slide over the water and is moving with the mass of the sea
behind it.

Have a second person bring you the dolly, which must be able to float
(i.e., made from aluminum or PVC) for what I'm about to describe. Put
the boat on the dolly in deep water and if possible strap it
down. Turn the boat stern-to the waves and surf it quickly in to shore
while you hold onto the side or stern.  Quickly pull the boat above
the wave line and turn it into the wind before derigging.

### Anchoring 

I have personally executed the retrieval methods described in this
article up to this point. I've done the beach methods in up to 20 kts
of wind from varying directions and 1m waves on sandy, rocky, and
muddy beaches. So, I know that they all work well with practice.

I have heard of another method for unprotected beaches, but never
tried it myself. That method is to use a mushroom anchor to put a ball
fender (a typical racing mark) at about shoulder depth, before
launching. Then, on return, the boat can be tied to this ball
temporarily while a solo sailor fetches their own dinghy from shore.
I can imagine this working if the ball is held well beyond the point
where waves are breaking, but that point is often too deep to stand
and work effectively with the boat and dolly.


Catamarans
===================================================================

Dry-sailed catamarans are a special case. They are most commonly
beach launched by dragging directly on the beach, or with
canoe-style wheels that fit under each hull instead of a dolly. 

The procedure is generally similar to the monohull dinghy case. 
The lack of keels and their stability makes catamarans easier to
launch and retrieve in some ways. In other ways it is harder.
Compared to a monohull, a catamaran has more mass, is much larger, and
has poor upwind performance when clawing off a leeward shore launch.

Here are some videos of catamaran beach launching:
