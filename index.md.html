<title>The Sailing Codex</title>

<br>I wrote these sailing notes for myself and my crew on topics
relevant to coastal cruising, day sailing, and dinghy racing. The
regional regulations and jargon referenced tend to focus on the US and
Canada. As of April 2023, I'm frequently updating these notes but
have no particular release schedule. Note the disclaimer on the bottom
of each page.
