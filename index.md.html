Welcome to the Sailing Codex! I wrote these sailing notes for myself and my crew on topics
relevant to coastal cruising, day sailing, and dinghy racing.

The regional regulations and jargon referenced tend to focus on the US and
Canada, where I sail most often. 

As of September 2023, I'm regularly updating these notes but
have no particular release schedule. Note the disclaimer on the bottom
of each page.

In my notes, I spell "gybe" as in British English vs. American "jibe", but
I use the American term "vang" vs. British "kicker" in an apparent inconsistency. 
That's because a) I live in Canada, not the UK _or_ America, b) I grew up _reading_ "gybe"
in British novels about square rigged boats, while sailing with
Americans on modern boats and hearing the word "vang," and c) they're
my notes to write, so I'm employing my own idiosyncratic
trans-Atlantic vocabulary.
