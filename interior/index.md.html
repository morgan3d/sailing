                  **Sailboat Living Space**
           Published 2023-07-06; Updated 2023-07-06

The living space of a sailboat boat must serve many purposes and fit within
a hull nominally designed foremost for sailing, not providing a
conveniently rectangular or stable base in which to build a home. This
leads to an interesting set of compromises across diverse design
solutions. The best layout depends on the goals of the owner and size
and cost of the boat. Since there then will be no single best for all
cases, understanding what makes a good interior requires understanding
the different desirable qualities and constraints on achieving them.

This article describes these and the ingenious (or otherwise)
solutions boat designers have arrived at for mid-sized cruising
sailboat interiors. This article may be relevant to you as an
experienced sailor interested in chartering or buying a boat. It could
be one of your early sources for researching interior aspects to
consider when evaluating a potential boat. Or, this article may be
relevant to you as a guest on someone else's boat, maybe with no
sailing experience at all. You'd like to know what to expect when you
come aboard for the weekend on a friend's boat.

"Mid-sized" covers monohulls from about 25' to 60'. That is the size
where it is practical and financially conceivable for a wide range of
people to live aboard them. Boats within this size range tend to
follow a similar plan, growing the space per room and maybe adding
extra bathrooms as the boats get larger. There are some notable
exceptions to that common plan that I'll call out throughout this
article.

I focus on monohulls as the most common case, and one which is also
the most easy to generalize about. Catamarans have very different,
vastly larger living spaces than this common monohull plan. I also have less
experience with them, as a primarily monohull sailor. This is not to
say that you shouldn't be very interested in them. Catamarans are
often luxurious even at 35'. Few people would choose a monohull over a
catamaran if their primary consideration was quality of life at a
sheltered anchorage. Outside of that case (which is indeed common for
chartering!), there are various tradeoffs of catamarans vs. monohulls.

The accommodations of boats below 25' are more like sail lockers with a cot
and table, if they have accommodations at all. So, they once again
differ strongly from the common case discussed here. That said, it is
_possible_ and potentially cozy to cruise an appropriately configured
20' boat, but it won't resemble anything described in this article.

Overview
===================================================

A sailboat's living space can be seen as a small, open-plan apartment
on the water. The main living and working areas of a boat are
described below with some key terminology.

*Saloon*
: Living room and dining room, which usually comprises a central table,
  sofa-like *benches* around the table, and some stowage shelves above
  the benches. This is the primary interior living space on most boats,
  and the public space anyone can use. If you have a private cabin,
  leave the storage in the saloon for the people sleeping in the saloon
  and for galley supplies and boat equipment. The *companionway* is
  the ladder or set of stairs leading from the exterior cockpit into
  the saloon.

*Nav Station*
: *Chart table* (desk) with access to critical electronics such as
  instruments, circuit breakers, and radio, which that corresponds to
  sort of a small home office. 

*Cabin*
: Bedroom with a door, personal storage, and maybe even a private
  bathroom. A *single berth* is a bed for one person and may be only
  half a meter wide. A *double berth* is closer to a land home
  "single" bed, although may not be rectangular. 

*Heads*
: A head (or heads in British English even for the singular) is the
  room with a toilet and usually a sink. A *wet head* has a shower
  faucet so that the same space can be used as a shower. Larger boats
  usually have a *separate shower* as a dedicated room with no toilet,
  or a fold-out glass partition so that the toilet and sink side of
  the room doesn't get wet. The *day head* is usually at the foot of
  the companionway, in the saloon. It is the one intended for everyone
  to use during the day, but is often also the head dedicated to
  one or more cabins at night.
  
*Berth*
: A berth is any bed, including one in a cabin. When referred to by
  itself, this means a bed in an area that has no door and may be
  public. A *quarter berth* or *pilot berth* is usually close to the
  nav station in the saloon. It is the traditional place for the
  captain to sleep when off watch during an ocean crossing, so that
  they can reach the cockpit quickly. In a more casual setting, a
  pilot berth is a convenient place for a child or pet to sleep and
  often is just used as storage. A *V berth* is a triangular bed in
  the front of the boat, which might have a curtain or partial wall
  for some privacy even if not in a cabin. A *side berth* or *saloon
  berth* is in the saloon and has little privacy; this is like
  sleeping on the sofa at home.  However, while they lack privacy,
  those saloon berths offer the most headroom, easy access to the
  head, and rock the least in waves.
  
*Galley*
: The galley is the kitchen, which may contain a *gimballed*
  (swinging) stove, sink, ice box (cooler), refrigerator, freezer, and
  storage for cooking utensils and food. Most of these are similar to
  the equipment in an RV or small apartment. Galleys are designed for
  cooking while underway. However, when cruising it is common to
  prepare food primarily at anchor and only cook hot beverages and
  sandwiches while sailing.

*Cockpit*
: Excepting the *helm* area immediately behind the wheel, the cockpit
  is the main outdoor living area on a boat. It is like a back porch
  on a house.
  While sailing, the cockpit
  where everyone will sit in reasonable weather, and is the base
  for socialising and eating. Some cockpits are extended at the stern
  with *sugar scoop* stairs and a small deck by the water for swimming
  and reaching a dock or the dinghy. Others have *swim platform*
  fold-down decks at water level for that purpose. Sometimes a grill
  or refrigerated storage will even be available in the cockpit.

*Foredeck*
: While sailing, the deck at the front of the boat is strictly off
  limits except for experienced crew performing specific duties. At
  anchor it becomes a wonderful place for sunbathing, reading, and
  socializing, like a poolside patio. Some 50' and larger sailboats
  have a separate *crew cabin* (which could also be used for guests)
  accessible only through a hatch on the foredeck.

*Technical Area*
: Also called the *engine room* in larger boats, this is the
  equivalent of a basement or boiler room on land. It contains large
  systems such as the engine, watermaker, airconditioning compressor,
  various pumps and filters, and maybe some tool storage. This area is
  generally never observed or used by guests or most crew.


Walkthroughs
===================================================

Here are examples of different boat interiors. I chose them to show
the range of interior designs. The Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 380 is the
sort of boat you are most likely to find yourself chartering or buying
for general purpose sailing. Consider the others relative to that:
oriented more towards racing, live-aboard, luxury, or day sailing.

The exact layout shown is not necessarily what any given boat will be
like even for that model and year.  Most new boats can be ordered with
several options and standard configurations. Older boats may have been
modified heavily from their original design on the interior. 

Prices vary significantly with the current market conditions, options,
and regional demand. They also do not factor in regional taxes and
import duties, which could be as high as 30%. So, prices listed are
useful for understanding the relative affordability range and level of
luxury and space to expect at that range, but are not accurate for
budgetting.


37' Production Performance Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

A representative production performance cruiser is the 2023 Jeanneau
Sun Odyssey 380. This is a 37' boat with two or three double cabins
and one or two heads. It costs about US$350k. It is designed to be
sailed by a couple with occasional guests for private ownership, or
packed with 6 people for a week long charter. It can easily be sailed
by one person in calm conditions and would feel luxuriously large to
live aboard for one or two by sailboat standards.

This is the standard modern boat configuration that meets the needs of
most people at a reasonable but upscale price. It is slightly larger
and more spacious than the common and more affordable 35' cruisers,
without going into the 40' territory that becomes harder to sail
single handed and significantly more expensive to own or charter.

This is about the smallest standard boat that six people can be
comfortable on for a social weekend aboard. Contributing factors to
the comfort level are the two heads, relatively good standing room
throughout, and wide, open saloon layout.

Similar boats include the Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 349, Beneteau Oceanis
34.1, Linjett 34, J/112e, Bavaria C38, and Beneteau Oceanis 38.1.

35' Semi-Custom Decksaloon
---------------------------------------------------

The [2023 Sirius 35 DS](https://www.sirius-yachts.com/yachts/35ds/) is
a semi-custom boat that is built to order with a specific hull and
extensive options and customization flexibility. In its most common
configuration, it is 35' long with two double-berth cabins, one head,
and a separate shower. It costs about US$500k in that configuration.

The Sirius is designed for a single sailor or a couple to
sail. It works well for families or a couple with occasional
guests. As a deck saloon with a clever layout, it has storage and
accommodation space closer to a 40' boat achieved by placing the
center cabin berth underneath the saloon.

This sort of boat is rare or nonexistent on the charter and used
market. It appeals most to experienced, live-aboard sailors. It
demonstrates the kind of highly optimized living space that is
possible on a boat for someone whose first priority is live aboard and
not price, racing performance, or maximizing berths for a weekend or
charter.

Similar boats in this category are the Nordship 380 DS, Nauticat 385,
Moody 41 DS, Sirius 40 DS, Nordship 420 DS, and Moody 45 DS.

38' Semi-Custom Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

The [2021 Island Packet 349](https://ipy.com/ip-349/) is representative of
cruisers designed that follow a more traditional layout than decksaloons but
are also optimized serious live-aboard use and sailing by a couple. It is
at the shorter/more affordable and coastal cruising (vs. bluewater) end of the spectrum,
as most boats in this style are above 40'.

Similar boats include the Bavaria C38, Hanse 388, Island Packet 439, 
Contest 42, Wauquiez Pilot Saloon 42, Bavaria Vison 42,
Southerly 42S, Allures 40.9, and Rustler 44 DS.

63' Luxury Performance Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

The
[2022 Nautor Swan 58](https://www.nautorswan.com/yachts/models/swan58/)
is about the largest standard sailboat interior before moving to
luxury yacht layouts. It is 63' long and costs about US$2.5M.

It has three or four cabins and three heads. It is suitable for a
family to live aboard, for charter with 8+ people, or to be sailed for
the owner by a small professional crew.

Although marketed to wealthy couples, this size and cost of boat still
is beyond what even many wealthy people can afford or would want to
handle without a full crew.

Etiquitte
===================================================================

Boat interior etiquitte is driven by two considerations: limited
privacy, and limited resources. A captain should always explain
expectations during the onboard briefing, so that guests and crew can
use the boat effectively and get along well with one another in a
small space. In return, everyone should be understanding and
communicate clearly with each other, especially for guests newly
learning boat life etiquitte.

I explain some of the conventions in this section. It is not intended
as a list of rules to memorize. I hope that you'll be able to get the
gist of what the etiquitte seeks to accomplish, to make sense of what
might seem like arbitrary requests. Trust others on the boat to help
you make learning about boat life interesting instead of
intimidtating.

Space and privacy are at a premium on a boat. It is similar to camping
or staying in a small cabin. As in those cases, an exaggerated regard
for each other's privacy helps compensate for the relatively small
amount of it. For example, walls are thin and the hull transmits sound
completely around the boat. So, try to keep your voice and music down,
especially when others are sleeping. Keep your gear to your own
spaces and avoid moving anyone else's.

Boats have limited electricity, cooking gas, fresh water, hot water,
and food. This is the case even on boats with *watermakers* and *solar
generators*. Avoid waste and ask the captain about expected usage per
day. It is probably around a few gallons of water total, enough
electricity for LED reading lights and fans at night, and electricity
for charging a phone. Running a laptop, taking a long shower or
washing clothes in the sink, plugging in larger electronics, or using
the built-in washer/dishwasher/stove/airconditioning may consume
disproportionate shared resources. Ask before doing those things.

<!-- Electricity can be recharged from the engine or renewables
(but the engine fuel is itself limited) and hot water re-heated using
the engine, but usually only during the day and at a slow rate. On
some boats fresh water can be produced using a *watermaker*, but only
if the surrounding water is clean and at a high electricity cost. -->


Nav Station
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there is never a door separating the nav station, that area
has critical equipment and documentation that should not be touched,
and the captain or crew on watch may need to sit there for navigation
or communication. So, assume that it is the captain's private domain
unless explicitly invited to use it.

Cabins and Berths
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If someone's berth is in a public area, such as the saloon, be conscious
of their lack of a private space. Keep that area clear of other gear
near bed time and do not sit on (or drip on!) their bedding if it is out.
If it is your berth, clean up your bedding and stow everything as quickly
as possible after you wake up.

Doors are kept open on cabins for good ventillation during the
day. That isn't an invitation to enter. I wouldn't enter someone
else's cabin without asking first regardless of whether they were in
it. However, because equipment is often stored in or only accessible
through a cabin, guests should assume that the captain or other crew
might need to enter their cabin and open storage cabinets.  Short of
an emergency, as captain I still _ask_ first, of course.

Head
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For ventillation, the head door is usually lashed or pinned open when
not in use. When at anchor, hatches and portholes are usually left
open in the head for more ventillation, but ask the captain.

Obviously, clean the toilet and sink after using them.  Boats have
limited fresh water supplies, including hot water. To help conserve
these, keep showers short (1-2 minutes total). Shut off water while
brushing teeth or soaping hands and face.

Etiquitte around access to a head that is only accessible only through
a cabin varies. Unless that is the only toilet on the boat, I'd ask
the captain which head they want people to use. If the private head is
in _their_ cabin, I'd avoid putting them in an awkward position by
waiting for them to explicitly offer their head instead of asking if I
could use it.

Heads aren't soundproofed. I'd like to reassure any easily embarrassed
folks that this probably won't be an issue for them most of the
time. During the day, few people are below decks, and while sailing
there is ambient noise.  At night everyone else is theoretically
asleep. Yes, at dinner time everyone is indeed gathered in the saloon
right next to the head. In that case, a bit of raucous conversation or
music in the saloon may be appreciated by someone who is on the toilet.

Ultimately, even on relatively luxurious boats the heads and access to
them just aren't as private as in a house. You have to accept that
_everyone_ is going to have the same human needs and be pragmatic
about ignoring sounds or turning your back when someone is walking
from the shower to their cabin.

Galley
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is a dedicated cook on the boat, then they will set the rules
for galley and food access. The galley is their domain in the way that
the helm and nav station are the captain's. When cooking duties
rotate, the person who is making the next meal is usually in charge of
the galley until they are done.

The refrigerator and freezer requires singificant electricity to run
and may have the compressor turned off for long periods to conserve
power. Avoid opening them repeatedly or leaving them open. Top loading
refrigerators don't heat up quite so quickly, but on a side-loading
fridge opening it empties all of the cold air.

TODO: Ask about snacking; 
be extra careful about contamination

It is polite for someone other than the cook to wash the dishes.
However, on some boats the cook doesn't want anyone else in the galley
or handling their pots. When washing up, be conscious of water
consumption. The two sink (or sink and washtub) method of soaking in
soapy water and only rinsing in running water is preferred for water
conservation. Some boats have a salt water tap for pre-rinsing and
only use fresh water for the final rinse.
