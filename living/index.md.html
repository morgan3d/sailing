                **Sailboat Accommodations**
           Published 2023-07-08; Updated 2023-08-08

![Below deck in the saloon of a [Bavaria C45](https://www.bavariayachts.com/sailing-yachts/c45/highlights/).](bavaria45.jpg width=540)

Living on a sailboat for any period of time can be exceptionally
enjoyable and rewarding. That is true whether you're taking a special
overnight trip, making a weekend getaway with friends, or making the
boat your primary home for months at a time.

When you're on a boat, you are close to nature and minimally impacting
the environment. You're on the water in a beautiful location. That
could be grabbing moment of peace and perspective off the city's
shores, or anchored in a remote and unpopulated location. There are
birds, fish, and marine mammals all around.

Aboard, you are self-sufficient in your off-grid and movable
home. That home is made of cozy spaces where everything is tidily in
its place and close at hand when you need it. I value boat interiors
and boat life as much for their tiny-home qualities as for the fact
that they enable sailing and exploring interesting places. 

![A perfect sunset at anchor off Barbados.](barbados.jpg width=420)
The satisfaction of life aboard is enhanced when the boat is well
designed and well suited to your goals, and you understand of how to
take best advantage of it. This article is for helping you to achieve
that by describing the accommodation options of a sailboat and how to
use (and share) them.

The functions of boat living spaces correspond to land homes we're all
familiar with. Yet, they must operate completely "off grid" and fit
within a relatively small and oddly shaped footprint. This leads to an
interesting set of compromises across diverse solutions for boat
designs. The best layout depends on the goals of the owner and size
and cost of the boat. Since there then will be no single best for all
cases, understanding what makes a good interior requires understanding
the different desirable qualities and constraints on achieving them.

![A magical, silent overnight anchorage at<br>San Francisco's bustling Ghirardelli Square.](ghirardelli.jpg width=420)
In this article, I describe these constraints and the ingenious (or
otherwise) solutions that boat designers crafted to them for mid-sized
cruising sailboats. I describe boat designs and features in light of
differing goals, such as individual overnights, week-long trips or
chartering, full-time liveaboard, and bluewater passagemaking.

I'm assuming that you're probably in one of two groups reading this
article. Maybe you're about to be a guest on someone else's boat,
perhaps with no previous cruising experience of your own. You'd like
to know what to expect when you come aboard for the long weekend and
how to prepare.

Or, maybe you're a sailor (or at least an aspiring one) who is
interested in chartering or buying a boat of your own. This article is
one of your early sources for researching interior aspects to consider
when evaluating a sailboat. You'll combine knowledge of life aboard
described here with other considerations such as sailing
characteristics, cost, and availability to find the right boat for
you.


Overview
===============================================================

A sailboat's living space can be viewed as a small, open-plan apartment
on the water. The main living and working areas of a boat are
described below with some key terminology. All images in this section
are from the [Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 380](https://www.jeanneau.com/boats/sailboat/2-sun-odyssey/664-sun-odyssey-380).

![Top view of interior living spaces in the typical layout of a sailboat.](jeanneau-380-layout2.png)


*Saloon*
: ![ ](saloon.jpg width=300) Living room and dining room, which usually comprises a central table,
  sofa-like *settees* around the table, and some stowage shelves above
  the settees. This is the primary interior living space on most boats,
  and the public space anyone can use. If you have a private cabin,
  leave the storage in the saloon for the people sleeping in the saloon
  and for galley supplies and boat equipment. The *companionway* is
  the ladder or set of stairs leading from the exterior cockpit into
  the saloon.

*Cabin*
: ![Owner's Cabin](owner-cabin.jpg width=300) Bedroom with a door, personal storage, and maybe even a private
  bathroom. A *single berth* cabin has a bed for one person that may
  be only half a meter wide. A *double berth* cabin's bed is closer to
  a land home "single" bed, although may not be rectangular.
  The *owner's cabin* is the nicest one, usually with a private 
  bathroom and more storage than the guest cabins.

*Heads*
: ![Wet Head](head.jpg width=300) A head (or "heads" in British English) is the room with a toilet and
  usually a sink. The *head* is also the name for the toilet itself;
  technically the room is a *head compartment*. A *wet head* has a
  shower faucet so that the same space can be used for bathing,
  usually by sitting on the toilet seat. Larger boats usually have a
  *separate shower*, which is a dedicated room with no toilet. Another
  popular option is a fold-out glass partition so that the toilet/sink
  side of the room doesn't get wet while bathing. The *day head* is is
  the one intended for everyone to use during the day, but is often
  also the head dedicated to one or more cabins at night.  It is
  usually at the foot of the companionway, in the saloon.  As in a
  house, an *ensuite head* is private with direct acess from a cabin.
  
*Berth*
: ![Aft Cabin Double Berth](aft-cabin.jpg width=300) A berth is any
  bed, including one in a cabin. When referred to by itself, this
  means a bed in an area that has no door and may be public. A
  *quarter berth* or *pilot berth* is usually close to the nav station
  in the saloon. It is the traditional place for the captain to sleep
  when off watch during an ocean crossing, so that they can reach the
  cockpit quickly. In a more casual setting, a pilot berth is a
  convenient place for a child or pet to sleep and often is just used
  as storage. A *V berth* is a triangular bed in the front of the
  boat, which might have a curtain or partial wall for some privacy
  even if not in a cabin. A *side berth* or *saloon berth* is in the
  saloon and has little privacy; this is like sleeping on the sofa at
  home.  However, while they lack privacy, those saloon berths offer
  the most headroom, easy access to the head, and rock the least in
  waves.
  
*Galley*
: ![L-shaped Galley](galley.jpg width=300) The galley is the kitchen, which may contain a *gimballed*
  (swinging) stove, sink, ice box (cooler), refrigerator, freezer, and
  storage for cooking utensils and food. Most of these are similar to
  the equipment in an RV or small apartment. Galleys are designed for
  cooking while underway. However, when cruising it is common to
  prepare food primarily at anchor and only cook hot beverages and
  sandwiches while sailing.

*Foredeck*
: While sailing, the deck at the front of the boat is strictly off
  limits except for experienced crew performing specific duties. But
  at anchor, it becomes a wonderful place for sunbathing, reading, and
  socializing. Think of it as a poolside patio. Some 50-60' sailboats
  have a separate *crew cabin* (which could also be used for guests)
  accessible only through a hatch on the foredeck.

*Cockpit*
: ![ ](cockpit.jpg width=300) Excepting the *helm* area immediately behind the wheel, the cockpit
  is the main outdoor living area on a boat. It is like a back porch
  on a house. While sailing, the cockpit where everyone will sit in
  reasonable weather, and is the base for socialising and eating. Some
  cockpits are extended at the stern with *sugar scoop* stairs and a
  small deck by the water for swimming and reaching a dock or the
  dinghy. Others have *swim platform* or *bathing platform* fold-down
  decks at water level for that purpose. Sometimes a grill or
  refrigerated storage will even be available in the cockpit.

*Nav Station*
: ![Nav Station](nav-station.jpg width=200) *Chart table* (desk) in the saloon, 
  with access to critical electronics such as
  instruments, circuit breakers, and radio, which corresponds to
  sort of a small home office and utility room. 

*Technical Area*
: Also called the *engine compartment* or *engine room*, this is the
  equivalent of a basement or boiler room on land. It contains large
  systems such as the engine, watermaker, airconditioning compressor,
  various pumps and filters, and maybe some tool storage. This area is
  generally never observed or used by guests or most crew.


These areas can be configured in various ways on even production
boats. Below are examples of variations for the running example of the
Jeanneau 380. Part of choosing the right boat is selecting the layout
best suited to your use. This is why understanding the tradeoffs is
important even once the particular desired yacht has been chosen.
Just as with cars and houses, it is also a fun passtime to configure
one's fantasy yacht even with no intention of purchasing. Many
manufacturers have interactive tools on their website as well as
catalogs showing all of the options.

Walkthroughs
===================================================

Here are examples of different boat interiors. I chose them to show
the range of interior designs. A 35-45' production performance cruiser
is sort of boat you are most likely to find yourself chartering or
buying for general sailing and casual cruising. From that average,
consider the other categories as shifts in priorites. They are
oriented more towards full time live-aboard, racing, day sailing, or a
luxury lifestyle. 

The exact layout shown is not necessarily what any given boat will be
like even for that model and year. Most new boats can be ordered with
several options and standard configurations. Older boats may have been
modified heavily from their original design on the interior. 

Prices vary significantly with the current market conditions, options,
and regional demand. They also do not factor in regional taxes and
import duties, which could be as high as 30%. So, prices listed are
useful for understanding the relative affordability range and level of
luxury and space to expect at that range, but are not accurate for
budgetting.


Production Performance Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------
Production performance cruisers are the standard modern boat
configuration. They meet the needs of most people at a reasonable
price, and comprise a majority of the charter market.

![Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 380](https://youtu.be/9X9HLcyBgQY?t=159 width=800 height=450)

A representative production performance cruiser is the Jeanneau
Sun Odyssey 380. This is a 37' boat with two or three double cabins
and one or two heads. It costs about US$350k. It is designed to be
sailed by a couple with occasional guests for private ownership, or
packed with 6 people for a week long charter. It can easily be sailed
by one person in calm conditions and would feel luxuriously large to
live aboard for one or two by sailboat standards.

The 380 is slightly larger and more spacious than the common and more
affordable 35' cruisers, without going into the 40'+ territory that
becomes harder to sail single-handed and significantly more expensive
to own or charter.

37' is about the smallest standard boat that six people can be
comfortable on for a social weekend aboard. Contributing factors to
the comfort level for that many people are the two heads, relatively
good standing room throughout, and wide, open saloon layout. For a
week-long charter it is a good size for a family of four or two
couples. To live aboard for long periods of time, it is a good size
for single experienced sailor or a couple.

Semi-Custom Decksaloon Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

Long term live-aboard boats are often new semi-custom decksaloons or
new (or used) traditional boats in the 1970s cruising style. These
trade spacious aesthetics and luxury amenities for storage space,
better galleys, and more robust systems. They differ from charter
boats in exactly the ways that a home differs from a vacation rental.

![Sirius 35 DS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJNFmRGnMV4 width=800 height=450)

The [Sirius 35 DS](https://www.sirius-yachts.com/yachts/35ds/) is
a semi-custom boat that is built to order with a specific hull and
extensive options and customization flexibility. It is 35' long, and
in its most common configuration it has two double-berth cabins, one head,
and a separate shower. It costs about US$500k in that configuration.

The Sirius is designed for a single sailor or a couple to
sail. It works well for families or a couple with occasional
guests. As a decksaloon with a clever layout, it has storage and
accommodation space closer to a 40' boat achieved by placing the
center cabin berth underneath the saloon.

This sort of boat is rare on the charter market. It appeals most to
experienced, live-aboard sailors. It demonstrates the kind of highly
optimized living space that is possible on a boat for someone whose
first priority is live aboard full time. It trades practicality and
comfort for low price, racing performance, or maximizing berths for a
weekend or charter.

I find the whole Sirius range of decksaloons to be exceptional for living aboard even in
the semi-custom cruiser category because of their relatively unique
interior layouts. They are the only boats I know of with a center cabin
even at 35' and 31' feet, and the 40 DS is one of the only boats with three
double-berth cabins and two heads. The galley is above in the raised
saloon, giving the cook great views, communication, and
ventillation. That is very attractive to me for short handed sailing
(where the cook is also on watch), and for not banishing cooking to
the more claustrophbic and motion-sickness inducing belowdecks.

Despite a favorably low freeboard, even the 31 DS still
manages to provide standing headroom throughout the entire
interior, and this is of course carried through to the larger boats in the range. That is another property that is rare in boat under 45' and
which makes extended living aboard much more comfortable. I chose the
35 DS as the exemplar for this category because there is no other boat
under 40' so practical and spacious for living aboard. The tradeoff
for all of this living space is the loss of the sleek abovedeck lines
of a traditional or performance cruiser.

Other boats in this category are the 
[Nordship 380 DS](https://www.nordship.dk/en/yachts/380DS), 
[Nauticat 385](https://nauticat.com/),
[Moody 41 DS](https://www.hanseyachtsag.com/moody/gb/yachts/moody-ds41/),

and 
[Moody 45 DS](https://www.hanseyachtsag.com/moody/gb/yachts/moody-ds45/).


Semi-Custom Traditional Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

Traditional cruisers have more attractive and classic exterior
aesthetics than decksaloons, but lack some of the space and light of a
raised saloon or pilothouse. Traditional cruisers are also often
slightly more affordable at the same length, although any live aboard
will be either more expensive or require much more work to retrofit
than a charter-class boat.

![Island Packet 349](https://youtu.be/Vfe4DnzMFXg?t=549 width=800 height=450)

The [Island Packet 349](https://ipy.com/ip-349/) is an example of
cruisers designed that similarly optimized to decksaloons for serious
live-aboard use and sailing by a couple, but follow a more traditional
layout below decks. The 349 is at the shorter/more affordable end of
the spectrum for such boats and is focused on coastal cruising. Many other
boats in this style are above 40' long and both more expensive and hardened
for bluewater passages.

Day Sailer/Pocket Cruiser
---------------------------------------------------

The [Beneteau First 24](https://www.beneteau.com/first/first-24) is
representative of day sailing and pocket cruising boats. It costs
about US$60k and is 24' long.

These are intended primarily for sailing during the day, without
living aboard at anchor. In fact, they are often launched from a
trailer.  However, they have minimalist accomodations that can be used
for a weekend when you don't mind roughing it a bit.

Think of this as a very nice camping tent on the water.  Depending on
how it is set up by the owner, the galley is usually a cooler and a
small alcohol or self-contained propane stove. The toilet is a
port-o-pottie (a chamberbot/bucket, maybe with some chemical
disinfectant) on the floor of the cabin; if you're not single-handing,
your only privacy when using it is the other person leaving the cabin
and looking away.

Racer
---------------------------------------------------

Serious racing boats have token
accommodation to support offshore multi-day races. There is nothing
luxurious or comfortable about them, and staying more than a night or
two on board is impractical. These are designed foremost to sail fast,
and reducing weight from the interior is key to making a boat fast.

![J/88](https://youtu.be/s-INjklcF_0?t=304 width=800 height=450)

The J/88 is an example of a high performance racing boat. It is 29'
long and costs about US$250k. It demonstrates the sort of living
compromises on a racing boat. The toilet is sitting right in the front
cabin, which itself has no door. The bowsprit retracts directly over
the berth in that cabin, and really that "berth" is intended as sail
storage. The crew sleeps in the saloon, which has no table as they are
expected to eat out of thermoses while sitting in the cockpit and only
sleep or navigate when below. The sink is a simple basin in the
saloon, and the nav station is merely a flat surface and chart
storage, with no way to sit at it like a desk. There essentially is no
galley--bring prepared food or use a [jetboil](https://jetboil.johnsonoutdoors.com/us).

The next
[step larger of a J/99](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcy_svecXRc)
adds a door to the toilet-sail locker-front cabin, saloon table, a
miniature but usable galley with a camp stove, and two aft cabins with
doors. There is no way to wash up except in the galley sink, and
essentially no storage.

I describe racing boat living conditions mostly to make clear that
a standard cruiser is relatively attractive and luxurious inside.
Racing boats are of course not intended for anything except hardcore
racing in private ownership, and the accommodations rarely will be used.

Similar boats include the

Luxury Yacht
-----------------------------------------------------------

The
[2022 Nautor Swan 58](https://www.nautorswan.com/yachts/models/swan58/)
is just about the largest typical sailboat suitable for owner operation 
and with a relatively standard interior, before moving to superyacht
levels. It is 63' long and costs about US$2.5M. This class of luxury
yacht is beautiful and spacious, although unfortunately not what most
people will be able to experience.

The Swan 58 has three or four cabins and three heads. It is suitable for a
family to live aboard, for charter with 8+ people, or to be sailed for
the owner by a small professional crew. The layout is scaled up version
of the Jeanneau and other performance cruisers.

Although marketed to wealthy couples and genuinely operable in good
conditions by two experienced sailors, this size of boat is beyond
what most people would want to handle without a full crew.

Superyacht
---------------------------------------------------

These boats are outside of the "mid-sized monohull" range that the
rest of this article considers. I include them because it is nice to
dream of spending a week on one would be like. They to show what a
sailboat living space can be when outside of any constraints on price,
size, and sailing it without a professional crew.

The more tasteful sailing superyachts have separate crew apartments
with galleys, walk-in engine rooms, spiral staircases, pianos,
hottubs, bars, libraries, and so on as beautiful mansions that sail
oceans. The [Spirit 111](https://spirityachts.com/sailing-yachts/the-superyacht/spirit-111/) and 
[Shenandoah of Sark](https://syshenandoah.com/) are a great examples 
from different centuries of the ridiculous excesses of
these boats. Which, I am nonetheless very jealous of and glad are
out there on the seas! The notion of architectural spaces or a grand piano
on a sailboat is wild.

![Spirit 111](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42FIyhCDDB4 width=800 height=450)

![Shenandoah of Sark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QZt2VwwdK0 width=800 height=450)

Superyachts are of course fully customizable or custom yachts, whether
built new or acquired and retrofitted. Their extreme price points
start above tens of million US dollars with no upper limit. Often only
one or two of a design are ever built.

Saloon
===================================================

The saloon is the indoor social heart of the boat in the way that the
cockpit is the outdoor one. When living at anchor, you'll spend most
of your indoor time here, on the settees.

Most saloons are nearly identical. There are choices of fabric and
wood color of course, and whether to have hull windows. The largest
variation in the saloon itself between similar sized boats is whether
they have two matching settees, one settee and two armchairs opposite
it, or a linear galley opposite a C-shaped or full-round settee.

A saloon is normally relatively low in the boat, with the coachroof
and side decks forming the ceiling. On older or more traditional
boats, this can feel a bit like living in the basement. Modern boats
have hull windows as well as portholes to make it more airy and give a
better sense of what is going on outside. *Raised saloons* lift roof a
bit and add coachroof windows for improved light and visibility.  True
*deck saloons* and *pilothouses* lift the roof and floor a _lot_--to the
point where it feels like a catamaran saloon with full visibility, and
there's extra accomodation space below. There are not many true
decksaloons that aren't motorsailors; Nordship, Sirius, and Moody are
the only ones in regular production currently, although there are many
older models and custom builds from others afloat.

![The [Hallberg-Rassy 400](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-400) offers twin armchairs as a saloon option.](hallberg-rassy-400.jpg width=650)

![The [Garcia 45](https://www.garciayachts.com/en/yachts/sailboats/exploration-45/) has a linear galley opposite the settee area.](garcia-45.jpg  width=600)

Boats built in the 21st century are quite wide (beamy), and often have
light colored fabric and wood. This makes the saloon bright and makes
it especially pleasant at anchor compared to classic cruisers.  For
strictly good weather, daylight coastal cruising, it is also nice to
have a wide saloon with high ceiling. This gives a pleasant airy
feeling and makes it easy to move around, especially with people
trying to pass each other when packing in lots of guests on a charter.

![The [Rustler 37](https://www.rustleryachts.com/rustler37/) is safe and practical on passage, and aesthetically traditional.](rustler-37.jpg width=380px) ![The [Bavaria C38](https://www.bavariayachts.com/sailing-yachts/c38) has space for relaxing at anchor, and modern styling.](bavaria-38.jpg width=380px)

However, for bluewater passages or other cruising in more serious
seas, it is better to have a saloon with only narrow spaces in which
to brace oneself. Open spaces are just areas that you can be thrown
across. This is one of the tradeoffs of boat design. A nice saloon 
at anchor is not a safe one while sailing, and vice versa. Choose
the appropriate boat for how you will use it most of the time.

Compare the Rustler 37 and Bavaria C38, which are about the same size.
The Rustler is designed to a traditional aesthetic with dark
materials. It is configured for safety and practicality at sea, with
lots of fiddles and poles to grab, and favors storage and narrow
spaces over room to stretch out. There's a full size nav station at
the foot of the companionway and only one aft cabin as the other side
is storage. Because of the storage and minimizing windows for
strength, there is less light and going into the saloon feels like
entering a basement. The Bavaria has light materials, hull windows,
full-length porthole style windows, and two aft cabins for more
guests. It is has a foot more beam than the Rustler and does not have
much saloon storage, so presents a much wider saloon.  Overall, it is
bright, spacious, and friendly like a vacation apartment. It is also
not a good place to be in a storm and has much less capacity for
provisions and gear on a long trip. Both the Rustler and the Bavaria
are excellent boats, for very different lifestyles and sailing goals.

The hot water tank and some safety equipment are usually stored under
the settees. There is also general purpose storage in there, including
for food. Since folks will be sitting (or sleeping!) on settees in the
evenings, plan ahead and favor settee storage for gear that you only
expect to need during the day. This avoids asking everyone to get up
and temporarily shuffle into cabins when something is needed.

The rails above the settees are great places for storage of books,
sunscreen, sunglasses, binoculars, and anything you want easy to
access easily.  The seat backs on the settees also fold down and have
storage pockets behind them that are only slightly less convenient.


Windows
---------------------------------------------------------------

![Three overhead hatches, A hull window on each side, and long overhead coachroof windows provide a lot of light in the saloon of this [Dufour 37](https://www.dufour-yachts.com/en/luxury-yachts/dufour-37/), which is accentuated by the light oak finish and white cushions.](dufour-37.jpg)

Modern boats often have multiple *hatches* overhead for light and
ventillation. These have bug screens that slide from one side
and light blocking screens from the other side. 

On the sides, *portholes* are standing height windows that open.
The standing height windows are also often called *coachroof windows*
regardless of whether they open.
These usually have snap on curtains for privacy and darkness. The
porthole over the galley stove is important for ventillation when
cooking--not just for fresh air, but to vent steam and the water vapor
produced by a gas stove.

Always keep hatches and portholes closed and latched while sailing.
For hatches with vents in them, ensure that the vent is also sealed.
Obviously closing these blocks rain or waves from splashing inside,
but it is also important for safety. Boats are designed to recover
from capsize and being swamped by waves only when all hatches are
closed. Even a small gap can produce shocking amounts of water ingress
and endanger the boat.

![Watching the Baltic sea race past<br>the hull windows of a [Sirius 40DS](https://www.sirius-yachts.com/yachts/40ds/).](sirius-hull.jpg width=400)
Some boats also have *hull windows* that provide more visibility and
light closer to the waterline. These are really nice when at sitting
height for providing a view and comfort. While underway, it is
fascinating to look out the leeward hull windows, which will be
underwater. You can see the water racing by. When sailing in clear
water you can see rocks, fish, and coral underwater, as if the ocean
were a giant aquarium.

For a boat that you own, porthole and hatch gaskets are a source of
annoying leaks and are something that has to be replaced periodically.
Good hull windows should last for quite a long time. While the concept
of having a large hole in the hull is obviously concerning, most
manufacturers seem to seal their hull windows quite well and the
actual glass may be stronger than the hull itself. I don't have any
safety concerns about these on a well-maintained boat built in a good
yard. Hatches with built-in solar fans are fantastic for getting
ventillation at anchor in the rain or when the boat is left on the
dock. They can be another failure point, of course, so need to be
inspected periodically. For offshore sailing I'd consider whether they
compromise the strength of the hatch as well.


Table
---------------------------------------------------------------
The central table has leaves that fold out to form a large dinner
table, and collapse to provide more room for people passing through.
The table also probably has a small amount of storage hidden under
the center, usually for wine bottles.

The pole that the table is attached to is either the actual mast (for
a "keel stepped mast") or a *compression post* for a deck-stepped
mast. Compression posts are more common in modern boats. That post is
structural. If you own the boat, obviously do not remove or modify the
compression post. In a storm, beware that a metal mast or compression
post is forming a large conductor sticking up that may be struck by
lightning. Masts are grounded around these to the keel, but I still
would avoid holding on to the post in a storm.

![Board games on a [Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 389](https://www.jeanneau.com/boats/sailboat/2-sun-odyssey/38-sun-odyssey-389)](board_game.jpg width=420)
When many people are seated around the extended table, beware that it
may be very difficult for any of them to slip out if the boat is
shorter than 45'. While eating or playing games the table is full and
the wings can't be collapsed. The only way in or out at that point is
at the end of the table. So, when someone needs to check the pot in
the galley, use the toilet, or poke their head out to check the
anchorage, everyone has to shuffle down the settee in order. It is
therefore best for the captain and cook to sit at the companionway end
of the table.


Berths
---------------------------------------------------------------

The settees are couches at day and overflow berths at night (or off
watch). While narrow and lacking privacy, these have the advantage
of easy access to the head, nav desk and cockpit, and high headroom.

![The starboard day bed set up in a [Hanse 388](https://www.hanseyachtsag.com/hanse/gb/yachts/hanse-388).](hanse-388.jpg width=400)
When a boat is wide enough for a U-shaped settee, the table often can
be lowered to form a large berth or day bed. This is nice for anyone
to lounge on and a favorite place of small children (or pets) to play
and nap. With a leeboard, it can even be a makeshift crib.

On traditional straight settees, there is often a board and extra
cushion that can be placed next to one settee to make it a wider
berth at night.

Bracing
------------------------------------------------------------------
While underway, always keep one hand on a bracing surface when walking
through the saloon. Most boats have overhead *grab rails*, as well as
and grooved ridges on the galley and nav desk called *fiddles* that
you can hold on to.

If you feel motion sick while in the saloon, head up to the
cockpit. Sitting below deck limits your view of the horizon and fresh
air, which can be disorienting.

Bilge
---------------------------------------------------------------

The saloon floorboards pull up, either with a giant suction cup or via
built-in rings. Underneath is cool but potentially damp storage
against the hull, which is ideal for cans and bottles.

The center area under the floorboards is the *bilge*, where any water
that comes into the boat runs down to. The bilge is ideally clean and
dry, although it may require frequent cleaning if folks are tromping
in with wet clothes and letting them run off onto the floor.  If sea
water accumulates in the bilge, then when you're sitting in the saloon
you'll smell dying microorganisms. 

The bilge has an automatic *bilge pump* in case of a serious leak to
help prevent the boat from sinking. If you hear it running
continuously, then take up the boards to determine whether water is accumulating
or the pump is having a problem.

For older boats, the bilge may be wet due to various leaks slowly
draining into it. Periodically cleaning out oil or anything solid that
drifts in there will reduce odors and the chance of the pump jamming.

In some older boats, the sink and shower drain their gray water into
the bilge, and then depend on the bilge pump to clear it out.  This
isn't great, as it will put extra hours on the pump and nobody wants
dirty washing water underfoot.


Nav Station
------------------------------------------------------------------

The nav station contains the VHF radio, SSB if the boat is equipped
with it, electrical breakers/switches for different systems, and the
nav desk. The water, holding, and fuel tank status is shown on gauges
here.

The desk is traditionally sized to hold admiralty charts, but as paper
charts are now only a backup navigation solution, nav desks are
getting smaller. On some boats the instruments and plotter are
mirrored to the nav station as well. 

![The starboard nav station on a [Nordship 380 DS](https://www.nordship.dk/en/yachts/380DS) is great for a night watch or piloting through weather. Route planning is more likely to be done from the comfortable settee to port while at anchor.](nordship-380DS-chart.jpg)

A deck saloon (or catamaran) often will have a nav station with large
plotter displays and outside visibility. It will likely have remote
autopilot and throttle controls as well. That is ideal for standing
watch in poor weather.

If you are the captain, the nav station is a good laptop desk for both
navigation work and general computer use. However, if you are crew or
a guest, don't use the nav station without an invitation. It has
critical systems and equipment that should not be touched casually and
also may require unimpeded access in an emergency.

Recent charter boats often forgo the desk. They use that space for a
larger settee and place the nav station controls on a wall. This is a
controversial choice to traditional-minded sailors, but pragmatic as
it reflects how most people really want to use the space. In practice,
I do my route planning navigation and weather forecasting at the
saloon table while anchored anyway. The table is larger and the settee
more comfortable than a nav station. Yet, when underway, a dedicated
navigation seat offers better bracing and the desk has fiddles to keep
tablets and laptops from sliding off. For a boat intended to make
passages I think a proper nav station is still essential, including
chart storage. When the power fails, iPad dies, nav system shorts out,
or GPS antenna falls off, there has to be a backup system
for navigation and that is paper charts.

This article isn't really concerned with racing boats and their
minimal accommodations. However, I'll observe that they tend to have
minimalist nav stations to reduce weight despite rather intense
navigation, weather forecasting, and communication needs. This is
again all in service of saving weight. What is nice about very
hardcore racing boats is that their interior navigation displays
swivel across the boat. This allows the navigator to sit on the
windward side and brace properly when the boat changes tacks, rather
than be tied to a specific side where the equipment is installed.


Companionway
---------------------------------------------------

On most boats, the companionway is a set of steep steps. For safety,
treat these like a ladder. Go up and down them facing the steps, while
holding on to the grab rail on the side.

On decksaloons, there may be no companionway at all. This is very nice
for moving between saloon and cockpit and communicating with crew on
each side.

The engine and at least part of the technical area is usually tucked
under the companionway. Beware that if someone is going to work on the
engine, then you might not be able to get in or out of the saloon for
a while and plan ahead.

Galley
===================================================

The galley is the kitchen of the boat. It usually has a stove,
freezer or refrigerator, and sink, along with food and utensil
storage and counterspace.

Galleys are described by their shape: linear, C, U, or L, and the side
of the boat: starboard or port. They are traditionally located at the
foot of the companionway for good ventillation. Newer designs move a
linear galley opposite the saloon seating for a more social
environment or locate it near the mast for more space.

![Valiant 42 U galley with a belt for bracing.](valiant42-galley.jpg width=350 attriburl="https://swiftsureyachts.com/valiant-42-surf-ride/" attrib="SwiftsureYachts")
For cooking while underway or in an unprotected anchorage, it is best
to have a galley with lots of bracing opportunities. The C galley or a
linear one with a relatively narrow space from a bracing surface is
ideal. These allow the cook to keep both hands free while secure.  L
and U galleys often have a large belt called a *galley strap* that the cook can use to brace
themselves. The downside of a strap is that the cook can't move back
quickly from a fire, hot pot, or dropped knife.

When cooking in calm conditions, U, L galley, and long linear gallies
are more pleasant because they provide space to move about,
especially if two people are in the area at once.

The main challenge in boat cooking is the limited preparation space. The
countertop is usually small to begin with. Since it is also the covers
for the sink and the refrigerator, it is necessary to plan carefully
and take out all cold ingredients, perform all washing and draining, etc. in
the right order and together to avoid having to constantly move everything.

Sink
------------------------------------------------------------

![Double faucet, double basin sink<br>in a [Linjett 34](https://www.linjett.se/en/linjett-34/) galley.](linjett-34-sink.jpg width=300)
Galley sinks have two basins. This facilitates soaking dishes in one
and rinsing in the other to reduce water use. It often also acts as
one full of dirty dishes and one used for washing. Older boats have
both fresh and sea water taps, with the sea water often provided
by a foot operated pump. Unfortunately, these are not popular on 
most modern boats due to the prevalance of watermakers, so a new
boat will likely have only pressurized fresh water.

Sinks drain directly overboard as they are considered gray water.
Favor approved marine or camping soaps and avoid pouring anything
toxic such as bleach into the sink, as it will run out into 
the surrounding water unless there is a (rare) gray water tank.

If the sink is well above the waterline then it will probably
drain on either tack when underway, although will work better on one
tack that is better aligned with the plumbing. If the sink is close
to the waterline then the outlet is also close to the waterline
and it will probably not drain while heeled on that side.

The drain connects to a *through-hull* valve with a *stop cock* that
should be closed when no-one is aboard, and when sailing. If there is
a salt water tap then that should also be closed when the sink is not
in use. A one-way valve prevents water from flowing back through these
even when the through-hull is underwater, but if that valve should
fail the boat could be flooded and sink from water ingress if the stop
cock is not closed.

Remember that hot water is provided by cooling the engine. The hot
water source is therefore limited and should be conserved. If the
engine has not been run for a day there is probably no hot water at
the sink at all.

I often turn off the water pressure system at night on the breaker
panel. This avoids the compressor turning on and waking me up when the
system loses a small amount of pressure due to air leaks. It means
that invariably I wonder why the galley sink has no pressure in the
morning while groggy and trying to make tea.


Refrigerator
------------------------------------------------------------

Many galleys have a single cold box unit for food storage. This can
act as an ice box (to save electricity), a refrigerator, or a
freezer. Some boats have a separate deep freeze. The top is warmer
and the bottom is cooler.

![Top view of a 12V marine refrigerator.](fridge.jpg)

The cold box will load from the top. This prevents the cold air from
spilling out when it is opened and conserves electricity from having
to re-cool the space. If the box is not opened and is full of cold
food, it will stay quite cold for days without power. Even if opened
frequently from the top it requires little power to keep cool due to
the insulation. A full cold box has less room for air and thus will
stay colder.

It is very nice if there is also a side door on the cold box. Opening
this spills most of the cold air. If underway, it potentially also
spills the objects in the box out onto the floor. However, when at
anchor and with sufficient power, this is really helpful for reaching
the frozen items and for cleaning the box.

Many boats have additional cold box storage in the cockpit for
beverages, which may not have a cooling unit.

Pack anything deep frozen into meal sizes, as defrosting part will be
impractica. Vacuum packing is great for minimizing space, freezerburn,
icing, but does create additional waste from the single-use plastic
bags.

Stove
------------------------------------------------------------

Boat stoves are usually *gimballed* so that they can swing as the boat
heels and remain upright. For this reason, they are also mounted on a
side of the boat instead of abeam. 

Small grippers on the side of each hob help keep pots in place, and
the entire stove has a high rim. The grippers are sometimes a problem
because they reduce the space available for wide frying pans and
cannot be removed entirely on some models.

### Electric

Most boat stoves are gas powered in order to achieve sufficient energy
density. There are a few induction and resistance electric
stoves. Induction electric is attractive because the surface does not
stay hot and it allows using renewable power sources.  However, only
very large sailboats have sufficient battery banks and solar for
induction cooking. There is also currently only one [marine induction stove](https://gn-espace.com/product/oceanchef-3-induction-cooker/) on the
market, and it is extremely expensive.

Microwaves are rare on sailboats because of their intense power draw.
When present, these are typically used while docked and on shore power
instead of battery.

There are two options for electric cooking on smaller boats.  The
first is a small RV-style separate electric stove hot plate, which can
be plugged into car-power 12V DC outlets or standard AC in the galley
and run off the house battery. The second is an electric kettle, with
the same two power options. I make even more hot beverages than meals,
and avoiding firing up the stove for this and eliminating the open
flame while sailing is desirable.

### Gas

![Stern gas locker with US LPG bottle.](propane.jpg width=320)
Stove fuel is typically Liquified Propane Gas (LPG) in North America
and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in Europe, based on what has a more
readily available supply in those regions.  Beware that the hobs on
the stove must be switched when changing between these fuel types, and
that the fittings for a given fuel might be different across
countries. CNG, which is primarily methane, is generally a safer fuel.
It contains less carbon and produces less carbon monoxide (an
asfixiation hazard) and less CO<sub>2</sub> (a greenhouse gas). LPG is
actually a mixture of propane and butane. It is more energy dense,
which is good for space efficiency.  LPG is heavier than air, so in
the unlikely event of a propane leak, there is the danger of the boat
filling with the gas and exploding instead of it escaping upwards.
Unfortunately, one is unlikely to have the opportunity to choose
between them as the practical choice is dictated by the intended
sailing region.

Gas stoves have several safety measures, making any sort of leak
unlikely. The gas bottles are stored in dedicated, vented lockers.
These are usually at the extreme ends of the boat. The bottles have
valves that should be kept off when not expecting to cook that
day. There is a manual valve with a flip switch near the stove that
must be opened to receive gas, and which falls down and closes with a
light tap. The stove itself has thermocouples, so that if the flame
blows out or is drowned by a pot overflowing the gas will shut
off. All areas where the bottles are stored or gas lines run inside of
the hull are vented (from the bottom, for propane).

![Preparing a breakfast of coffee and<br>fried eggs on a gas stove.](eggs.jpg width=420)
Fire, carbon monoxide, and natural gas/propane alarms should be
installed in every boat. The galley should be ventillated (with an
open porthole at anchor and open companionway while sailing) to
release carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as
moisture. Boiling water and fuel combustion both release significant
moisture into the cabin, which will condense on the colder hull and
create mold if not vented.

In the 1970s, kerosene, alcohol, and diesel stoves were common. These
are almost unheard of today for polution and safety reasons. Some
expedition boats will still use wood stoves for heating and
occasionally cooking. Wood stoves have the advantage that the fuel can
be replenished in remote areas, and they also dry the cabin. A wood
stove is obviously dangerous in that it has fewer safeguards and
presents a large hot surface within the cabin.


Food Storage
---------------------------------------------------------

Because cold storage is limited, prefer storing anything possible
outside of the cold box. Hang fruits and vegetables in mesh hammocks
so that they have good airflow and are not bruised while sailing.

European eggs are unwashed. They can and should be stored outside 
of the cold box and will last for weeks without spoiling (although taste 
significantly better when fresher, of course). American eggs are sold
washed and must be kept cold. They will last even longer, but consume
space.

Repack items from their grocery store boxes into smaller and
watertight/pest-proof containers. For example, put grains, cereals,
and dried beans into tightly sealing plastic bins. Using many small
bins reduces the risk of spoiling the entire supply if something goes
wrong and also makes it easier to find places to store them.

Always remove all paper wrapping from cans and cardboard before
bringing provisions aboard. Insects lay eggs between the container and
the wrapper, and will then hatch at sea and spoil food. Both because
the labels have this risk and because they may become wet, scratch the
names of the contents into the top of aluminum cans.

Cans and bottles are watertight, heavy, and may be best stored in a
cool location.  Under the floorboards is the best spot for
these. Lighter foods can be stuffed into storage around the galley and
saloon. Consider making a map of where everything is and an inventory
of what remains if afloat for more than a few days.

Remember that everything will be tossed about a bit while sailing when
storing it.


Waste
---------------------------------------------------------

There is a small waste bin in one of the kitchen cabinets, and then
excess garbage and recycling is stored in lazarettes (lockers) on the
cockpit or an unused cabin when on a long trip.

There's usually no composting on a boat due to tight quarters. In many
areas it is legal to dispose of food preparation waste overboard, but
check carefully to be within regulations and protect the marine
environment.

Part of living closer to nature and with a smaller footprint is
producing less waste, especially waste that is non-degradable.  This
is a good value always, and especially practical when living on a boat
because any waste generated on board will be with you until the next
landfall.

Food waste can be minimized by taking steps to reduce spoilage,
prepare only what is needed, and store and then eat leftovers.

Packaging waste is best eliminated by purchasing food that minimizes
packaging at sale, and then second by removing packaging and storing
supplies in reusable containers when on board. Cans can be crushed and
cardboard folded down to reduce the space of inevitable recylable
storage. Keeping the trash as clean as possible of food products
reduces odors and attracting insects at anchor.

It is normal for a family of four to produce only a few litres of
garbage and recycling in a month on board, with careful preparation to
avoid food preparation waste. When chartering for a week, it is harder
to minimize waste to that level. The same family might produce one bag
of waste after only a week, because they will not have reusable
storage containers or as much choice when purchasing provisions.


Cabins
===========================================================

Berths
----------------------------------------------------------
A typical double berth is entered by crawling in from the edge
with the pillows. The end where your legs go usually has a lower
ceiling, and the sides are flush with the walls. This gives you
maximum headroom and keeps you from rolling out of bed if the boat
rocks.

The settee berths in the saloon are singles that usually allow
entering entering from the side as in a land bed.  A *pullman* berth
is in a cabin but also has one side accessible and one side against
the hull or another wall. The term is usually applied when that berth
is in a cabin, to either singles or doubles.

A more luxurious *island* berth is accessible from both sides. This
makes it easier to enter and leave without disturbing a partner in a
double berth. Lee boards are required on both sides and often down the
center for such a berth when underway, so usually one sleeps in a
pilot berth or the saloon when sailing and the island bed at anchor.

![The [Bavaria C46](https://www.bavariayachts.com/sailing-yachts/c46) is optimized for charter or entertaining, with a large galley and four private cabins with ensuite heads. The two aft heads can serve as day heads.](bavaria-c46.jpg)

The berths in fore cabins are often raised up quite high. The primary
reason for this is safety. If there is an emergency such as a fire, it
may not be possible to escape through the saloon.  From the high bed
you can access the hatch on the ceiling and climb out onto the deck
even if short or unable to perform a pullup.

A *pilot/quarter berth* is usually tucked under part of the cockpit and
right behind the nav station in the saloon. It will have very narrow
leg room and is the one case of a single berth accessed from the
pillow end.

Double Cabin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two formats for a cabin with two single berths. One is 
side-by side single pullman berths with a narrow space between them.
This is usually an aft cabin in which a drop-in board converts the
two singles to one double berth. This gives a relatively spacious feeling
cabin with a small bit of privacy (or at least protection from a partner
who moves in their sleep) for two people sharing it.

The other is style is bunkbeds, where one single berth is above
another.  The top berth might fold up when not in use. The bunkbed
style is in a very narrow cabin that is forward, so feels less
luxurious than the side-by-side format.  It appears on boats intended
to host expeditions, professional crew cabins, and children. Often a
bunkbed cabin on a private boat is and used mostly for storage and
only slept in when there are a large number of guests or passage crew.

![The aft single, double-berth cabin and the double, single-berth bunkbed cabin in a [Beneteau Oceanis 46.1](https://www.beneteau.com/oceanis/oceanis-461).](beneteau-oceanis-46.1.jpg)


Owner's Cabin
----------------------------------------------------------- 

The largest cabin is usually called the *owner's cabin*. This the
equivalent of a master bedroom suite in a house. This cabin stretches
the full width of the boat, has standing headroom, offers additional
storage, and often provides an ensuite private head. Charter boats
typically favor two smaller cabins in place of a single owner's cabin.

The owner's cabin is aft in 40' and larger boats that also have center
cockpits. The owner's cabin is usually forward in all other cases, in
order to have better headroom. A few interesting boats have the best
cabin in the center, which I'll discuss in the next section.

![The forward owner's cabin<br>in a [Hallberg-Rassy 400](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-400).](hallberg-rassy-400-owner.jpg width=390) ![The large aft owner's cabin<br>in a [Hallberg-Rassy 40C](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-40c)](hr40c-owner.jpg width=390)

Consider two Hallberg-Rassy models, the 400 versus the 40C. Both boats
have the same overall length of 43', have identical hulls, offer the
same saloon and fore cabin options, and were introduced at the same
time in 2020. Both have very pretty lines, a hard (i.e., glass)
windscreen, and the practical option of a hardtop dodger.

![Comparison of the Hallberg-Rassy 400 and 40C.](hr-40-compare.png)

The [400](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-400)
was designed for charter, or long term live aboard for a family with children. It has
the option of three smaller cabins instead of two, and two head
compartments. The bathing platform is easy to reach from the aft
cockpit. The owner's cabin is forward in the V-berth, which can be
an island bed, or smaller to make room for an ensuite head.
This cabin is preferable to the aft cabins and is generous
compared to smaller boat, but is not as luxurious as the owner's cabin on
its sister ship, the 40C.

The [40C](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-40c)
was designed for private ownership. It offers an enormous aft cabin
for the owner as well as a double-size galley for serious cooking and
additional food storage. This aft cabin forces the cockpit forward and
upward ("C" is for center cockpit) because it creates a bulge at the
back to have sufficient headroom. The drawbacks of this layout are the
surprising loss of the second head (one would have expected an ensuite
head for that aft cabin), reduced access to the bathing platform, and
a raised up helm (shown in red). A higher helm is drier, but rocks
more and has worse visibility when docking. 

![[Hallberg-Rassy 400](https://www.hallberg-rassy.com/yachts/hallberg-rassy-400) aft cabin.](hallberg-rassy-400-aft.jpg width=260)
Compare the difference between the full-beam, high headroom owner's aft cabin
of the 40C with the guest aft cabin of the 400, which is typical of
most boats. Having the double width and extra hatch and windows makes
a large difference.

Overall, both boats are terrific and I like the choices Hallberg-Rassy
made for different use cases. Although driven by the accommodation
needs for a live-aboard owner, that center cockpit is also better for
the offshore sailing that a private owner might experience. It enables
a boom-end traveller and provides better stern protection. Between
them, I'd definitely choose the 40C for extended live aboard, but the
400 to charter for a week in the Mediterranean with friends.

![Forward owner's cabin in a [Linjett 34](https://www.linjett.se/en/linjett-34/)](linjett-34-vberth.jpg width=400)
At 40' and below, owner's cabins may still be spacious or
have private heads, but are not as luxurious. Yet, the space doesn't
really concern you much when you're asleep. The question is whether the 
cabin is practical for your intended use and feels good to you. 
The owner's cabin is your
private room away from children and guests during the day, the room 
where you'll store and change clothes (sometimes while wet, or in the dark,
or next to a sleeping partner, or while wearing layers and foul weather gear), as well as
your bed at night.
Light finishes, hull
windows, and extra hatches affect the perceived space significantly,
and a dark, cozy traditional interior or light modern one is also a
matter of taste. Headroom over the bed is nice to enable sitting up to read,
but that's not where you're putting on your pants or reaching over your
head to pull on a shirt.

![Forward owner's cabin in a [Tartan 365](https://www.tartanyachts.com/models/tartan-365/)](tartan-365-owner.jpg width=400)
I find that the most desirable properties in an owner's cabin when
really living on the boat are standing headroom by the closet; enough
footroom in the berth for two; shelf storage at hand for books, water,
phones, and flashlights; and sufficient gear storage, even if it is
under the berth.


Center Cabin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A center cabin right next to the mast and above the keel is the best
location in the boat. Unfortunately, few boats under 60' have this
luxury.

A center cabin is close to the center of mass of the boat. This means
that it moves the least in waves when underway or at anchor. It is
also far from the bow and stern, which are where waves are most likely
to pound and make noise when you are trying to sleep. The center of
the boat typically has the highest headroom.

There are a few reasons that few boats have center cabins. A
keel-stepped mast or the compression post of a deck-stepped mast, and
the keel access are in the center of the boat. So, only half of the
beam is available for use by a center cabin or that cabin has a pole
int he middle of it. So, it is much easier to place an uninterrupted
double berth in the fore or aft cabin than at the center.

The center is also typically where the saloon is, and few designers
are willing to shorten the social saloon dramatically to create a
large private space. Decksaloons are the most likely to have a center
cabin at 40' or smaller because they lift the saloon above this cabin,
although that takes away some headroom over the berth compared to a
fore cabin.

The second best option for capturing some of a center cabin's advantages
is a large fore cabin that extends aft to or past the mast, with the head
of the berth as close to the center of the boat as possible.


Cockpit
======================================================================

![Dinner at the cockpit table of a [Catalina 425](https://www.catalinayachts.com/ocean-series/catalina-425/).](catalina-425-cockpit.jpg)

The saloon is the open plan living room of a boat, and the cockpit is
its expansive patio. The cockpit serves double duty. It is where the
boat is sailed from, and acts as a working space and control room. But
it is also a well-protected space that has light and ventillation,
seating, and usually a table. Except in serious weather, the cockpit
is usually the best place to spend one's time and appreciate the
surrounding environment. It is also the best place to avoid motion
sickness, due to clear views of the horizon and fresh air.

Modern cruising boats are designed with most control lines away from
the center of the seating, to allow sailing without disrupting guests
or off-watch crew. 

The folded up center table is good for bracing in a wide cockpit while
sailing.  When extended at anchor it is great for eating, working with
paper or laptops, and playing games.

The *dodger* is a plastic or glass windshield and canvas-style top
that protects people at the fore end of the cockpit from sun, water,
and wind.  The *bimini* is a fold-out canvas-style sun and rain shade
for the rear of the cockpit. The bimini can't be used on passages
because it creates excess windage and cannot withstand strong weather,
but is ideal for day sailing or coastal cruising in reasonable
weather.

Liveaboard boats in cold climates have completely sealable cockpits
with plastic zippered windows to retain heat and keep out wind and
snow. In hot climates, additional sunshades can be rigged from the
shrouds and mast to shade the decks and sides of the cockpit.

A grille mounted on the side of the railings is great for cooking
outdoors. It should hang over the water, so that any coals that fall
land in the water instead of the cockpit. 50' and larger modern boats
often have built-in grills and outdoor sinks and coldboxes to enable
cooking while standing on the bathing platform, a wonderful luxury
at anchor.


Heads
=====================================================================

The heads are the bathrooms of the boat. They are much like a land
bathroom in a reasonably sized and equipped cruising yacht, but
everything is smaller to save space, and water conservation is
essential.

Sink
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The sink in the head is like the one in the galley. It has a limited
supply of hot water, and may have a salt water tap with a foot pump.
It may not drain on one tack when heeled, and the stop cock should be
closed when not in use while sailing or when the boat is left unattended.
The sink drains overboard, so be careful what is put in it.

A good head sink has a deep basin so that water does not slosh out and
so that it can be used for washing clothes and hair.  In a smaller
boat, the sink faucet may be on an extension hose so that it can be
used as a showerhead.


Shower
----------------------------------------------------------------

![Wet head in a [Marlow-Hunter 37](https://www.marlow-hunter.com/mid-size-keelboats-31-37-fleet/hunter-37).](mh37-head.jpg width=420)
A *separate shower* is either a glass partition that folds out and
protects the toilet and sink area from being wetted, or an entirely
separate compartment. These are common on 35' and larger modern boats
but rare on older boats. A *wet head* has the shower right in the
same area. A shower curtain may protect the walls a bit. 

When underway, sitting on the closed toilet lid or on a seat in the
shower is both the only safe way to wash, and also gives a lot more
space for elbows and headroom.

Unless you know that you have a large supply of fresh water, conserve
water in the shower. Quickly rinse. Lather up your whole body, and
then rinse again. For a passage, I wash singificantly less than I
would at home and use a washcloth instead of spraying myself to keep
the room drier and conserve water.

When cruising in relatively remote area with warm weather, the head
shower is often the least attractive way to wash. Instead, one can
keep clean primarily by swimming or washing in the cockpit with
buckets of salt water, and using the shower sparingly to remove
salt. There are special soaps and shampoos that lather in salt water.
A solar shower hung from the mast or stays allows showering while
standing on deck without needing the engine for hot water. A built-in
cockpit or bathing platform shower allows showering in fresh water
with plenty of elbow room.

Toilet
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a marine toilet is not too different from a land one. It is just
a bit smaller and one has to be more careful about what goes in it,
whether using a salt water, fresh water, or composting toilet.

However, _maintaining_ a marine toilet is one of the more compromised
points of boat life versus land life. It is important to choose the
right solution for your needs based on many tradeoffs. This is
basically choosing which kinds of unpleasant maintenance tasks you are
willing to take on in exchange for which you'd very much like to
avoid. No matter which ones you select, a certain amount of pragmatism about bodily needs
and some inevitable bathroom cleaning, maintenance, and accidents is
required.

To quote one of my salty cruising mentors, "if you can't say 'poop'
then boat ownership is not for you."

### Standard

The common marine toilet (which is also called a *head*) looks like a
slightly small land toilet. It has a valve for switching between
filling with sea water and draining, and a pump handle for making
the water flow in or out. Unless far at sea, the *black water*
from a toilet is always pumped into a holding tank to avoid pollution,
and then emptied at a marina.

Using the toilet involves first filling the bowl with water,
addressing your bodily needs, and then pumping the bowl it clean at
the end. It is very important to avoid clogging the plumbing. There is
special marine/septic tank toilet paper that is thin and degrades
quickly.

If a large quantity of toilet tissue lodges, or anything else is
flushed (non-marine toilet paper, tampons, tissues, paper towels,
condoms, food waste), the pipes are likely to clog. Clearing these is
not the same as on a land toilet: one has to disassemble the system,
and that will spill raw sewage and whatever caused the clog into the
boat.

Because a toilet clog is such a horror on a boat, many owners ban
"anything that hasn't passed through a human body first" from being
put into the toilet, and have a waste basket for used toilet paper. To
make that less offensive, used paper can be put into dog waste bags
first, or avoided entirely by using a spray of water or hands to clean
and then washing those hands well.

It is important to leave a marine toilet in the locked closed and
dry-bowl setting when done, so that water can't flow into it from
outside. When leaving the boat, the stopcock should be closed as on a
sink.

When a (clean) marine toilet smells bad, it is not usually the waste
causing the smell. It is microrganisms from the sea water that are
dying in the non-aerated water in the pipes. Always flush the system
thoroughly so that the waste reaches the holding tank, and then before
going to bed pour fresh water in from the shower head or sink faucet
and pump that towards the tank. Replace plumbing every few years if it
begins to build up odors, and occasionally pour vinegar into the head
and flush it. A well maintained head should not have bad odors when it
has not been closed up.

### Fresh Water Heads

Boats with watermakers and high capacity tanks can run the toilets on
fresh water instead of sea water. This avoids odors and reduce the
maintenance needs of valves and plumbing caused by urine precipitation
in salt water.

Fresh water can also be run to a bidet function, reducing the need for
paper and the risk of clogs that it creates.

### Powered Flush

Electric pump flushing toilets avoid the need to operate the manual
pump and valves. This provides an experience closer to on land. They
are often paired with a *macerator*, which is like a garbage disposal
grinder for the waste. That reduces the chance of clogs from paper
and other sources. Macerators are even more fragile than the plumbing
itself if inappropriate objects are flushed.

While a powered flush and macerator toilet is by far preferable to
_use_, the tradeoff is that it is not ideal to maintain. That is two
more complex systems that can fail. When they fail, one is both doing
fairly disgusting maintenance and using a bucket for a toilet for a
day. So, these are unsurprisingly most often found on boats that are
only day sailed or have a professional crew so that the owner can
avoid the unpleasantness.

### Composting

A marine toilet when used with a holding tank is really not an ideal
system for handling human waste. The holding tank is often under a
berth. It breeds bacteria and requires treatment before it can safely
be released. The holding tank must be pumped out, which varies from a
usually mildly unpleasant experience to a sometimes wildly disgusting
one. The plumbing requires maintenance, which is never a happy task
and can also be a truly disgusting one if something fails unexpectedly
or there is a clog. Finally, sailing around with the weight and wasted
space of raw sewage under one's berth is also undesirable.

The best alternative is a modern *dessicating* toilet such as the [Air Head](https://airheadtoilet.com/)
or [Nature's Head](https://natureshead.net/). This is called a
*composting* toilet but does not actually compost when in use on the
boat. These are very different from traditional "composting" heads, which
were essentially buckets of sawdust used as cat-style litterboxes for people
and had several drawbacks.

A modern composting toilet avoids the water systems and plumbing
altogether. They separate and dessicate (dehydrate) dry waste from the
liquid waste. This eliminates many odors, significantly reduces the
environmental impact, removes the dependence on and cost of pump out
facilities, gives back substantial space for storage, eliminates the
extra weight of storing hundreds of litres of waste and sea water, and
avoids all of the disgusting worst case scenarios.

Instead of pumping out at a marine facility like a holding tank,
a composting toilet is emptied by
dumping a liquids bottle daily and carrying a trash bag of dried
solid waste (it looks like mulch at that point) to any dumpster.

The tradeoff for avoiding worst cases and large maintenance tasks of a
flush toilet is that every use of a composting toilet is slightly less
convenient. Composting toilets have trap doors over the solids storage
area and one has to be careful not to let liquids into that
compartment. The liquids bottle must be monitored to avoid overflow. A
spray bottle of watered down vinegar and good brush are probably wise
to keep on hand. The emptying task for the solids is not too hard or
unpleasant, but there is some planning and work involved in
re-stocking the storage with the coconut husk or peat moss used within
them.


Etiquitte
===================================================================

Boat interior etiquitte is driven by two considerations: limited
privacy, and limited resources. A captain should always explain
expectations during the onboard briefing, so that guests and crew can
use the boat effectively and get along well with one another in a
small space. In return, everyone should be understanding and
communicate clearly with each other, especially for guests newly
learning boat life etiquitte.

I explain some of the conventions in this section. It is not intended
as a list of rules to memorize. I hope that you'll be able to get the
gist of what the etiquitte seeks to accomplish, to make sense of what
might seem like arbitrary requests. Trust others on the boat to help
you make learning about boat life interesting instead of
intimidtating.

Space and privacy are at a premium on a boat. It is similar to camping
or staying in a small cabin. As in those cases, an exaggerated regard
for each other's privacy helps compensate for the relatively small
amount of it. For example, walls are thin and the hull transmits sound
completely around the boat. So, try to keep your voice and music down,
especially when others are sleeping. Keep your gear to your own
spaces and avoid moving anyone else's.

Boats have limited electricity, cooking gas, fresh water, hot water,
and food. This is the case even on boats with *watermakers* and *solar
generators*. Avoid waste and ask the captain about expected usage per
day. It is probably around a few gallons of water total, enough
electricity for LED reading lights and fans at night, and electricity
for charging a phone. Running a laptop, taking a long shower or
washing clothes in the sink, plugging in larger electronics, or using
the built-in washer/dishwasher/stove/airconditioning may consume
disproportionate shared resources. Ask before doing those things.

<!-- Electricity can be recharged from the engine or renewables
(but the engine fuel is itself limited) and hot water re-heated using
the engine, but usually only during the day and at a slow rate. On
some boats fresh water can be produced using a *watermaker*, but only
if the surrounding water is clean and at a high electricity cost. -->

Companionway
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to avoid blocking the companionway by standing in it or leaving
gear on the stairs. Especially in wet or cold weather, it is quite
pleasant to stand on the companionway steps with only your head poking
out into the cockpit. However, this blocks everyone else from going in
or out, blocks the airflow for those below deck, and makes it hard for
them to hear and see out. Consider that the cook's view of the world
is probably your backside right next to their face in this position.

Standing in the companionway is also dangerous, as you're poorly
braced if the boat is suddenly struck. At anchor this isn't quite so
much of a concern, of course, but blocking the doorway remains
irritating.


Nav Station
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Although there is never a door separating the nav station from the
rest of the saloon, the nav station are area has critical equipment
and documentation that should not be touched, and the captain or crew
on watch may need to sit there for navigation or communication. So,
assume that it is the captain's private domain unless explicitly
invited to use it.

Cabins and Berths
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If someone's berth is in a public area, such as the saloon, be
conscious of their lack of a private space. Keep that area clear of
other gear near bed time and do not sit on (or drip on!) their bedding
if it is out. If your berth is a saloon settee, clean up your bedding
and stow everything as quickly as possible after you wake up so that
others can use the space--and to keep them from sitting on your clean
sheets in potentially dirty and salty gear.

Doors are kept open on cabins for good ventillation during the
day. That isn't an invitation to enter. I wouldn't enter someone
else's cabin without asking first regardless of whether they were in
it. However, because equipment is often stored in or only accessible
through a cabin, guests should assume that the captain or other crew
might need to enter their cabin and open storage cabinets.  Short of
an emergency, as captain I still _ask_ first, of course.

Head
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For ventillation, the head door is usually lashed or pinned open when
not in use. When at anchor, hatches and portholes are usually left
open in the head for more ventillation, but ask the captain before
doing so.

Obviously, clean the toilet and sink after using them.  Boats have
limited fresh water supplies, including hot water. To help conserve
these, keep showers short (1-2 minutes total). Shut off water while
brushing teeth or soaping hands and face. Beware that water is heated
from the engine. The tank will easily keep it warm for 16-24 hours,
but it is only replenished when the engine runs. Therefore, in the
morning there is limited total hot water for showers and washing up,
so in addition to conserving all fresh water, be mindful of the amount
of hot water consumed.

For a manual pump toilet, pump about four times if the tank is in the
head compartment and about seven times if it is not (which usually
means it is under the V-berth and relatively far away). This is
because you aren't just emptying the bowl. You're moving the waste all
of the way through the hoses to the tank or out of the boat. Leaving
it sitting in the hoses causes them to eventually smell or build up
clog deposits.

When leaving the boat, or if you are the likely last one using the
toilet at night, spray fresh water from the sink or shower hose into
the toilet, and then pump it dry. Most of the smell from a marine
sewage system is not from waste. It is from microorganisms that
came in with the sea water and then decomposed in the hoses
due to lack of oxygen. Leaving only fresh water in the hoses and
rinsing the last sea water coating the bowl minimizes odors.
Some boats with watermakers use fresh water in the toilets, so this
step isn't necessary (nor is it on the Great Lakes).

Etiquitte for access to a head that is only accessible only through a
cabin varies. Unless that is the only toilet on the boat, I'd ask the
captain which head they want people to use. If the private head is in
the captain's own cabin, I'd avoid putting them in an awkward position
by waiting for them to explicitly offer their head instead of asking
if I could use it.

Heads aren't soundproofed. I'd like to reassure any easily embarrassed
folks that this probably won't be an issue for them most of the
time. During the day, few people are below decks, and while sailing
there is lots of ambient noise. At night, everyone else is
theoretically asleep. Only at meal time is everyone gathered in the
saloon right next to the day head. In that case, a bit of noisy
conversation or music in the saloon may be appreciated by someone who
is on the toilet and self conscious. 
Ultimately, even on relatively luxurious boats the heads and access to
them just aren't as private as in a house. You have to accept that
_everyone_ is going to have the same human needs and be pragmatic
about ignoring sounds or turning your back when someone is walking
from the shower to their cabin.

Galley
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is a dedicated cook on the boat, then they will set the rules
for galley and food access. The galley is their domain in the way that
the helm and nav station are the captain's. When cooking duties
rotate, the person who is making the next meal is usually in charge of
the galley until they are done.

The refrigerator and freezer requires significant electricity to run
and may have the compressor turned off for long periods to conserve
power. Avoid opening them repeatedly or leaving them open. Top loading
refrigerators don't heat up quite so quickly, but on a side-loading
fridge opening it empties all of the cold air.

Ask about snack foods and beverages. Because the food supply is fixed
once the boat leaves shore, the cook has carefully planned for meals.
A random item grabbed as a snack might be a key ingredient needed for
tomorrow's dinner. Also be careful to not disturb the careful packing
of food, especially in the cold storage. Items that must be kept 
frozen are on the bottom, those that should not freeze are at the top,
and everything is squeezed in because there is limited space compared
to a land refrigerator. Someone rifling through there can disturb the
order as well as jumbling items so that they don't fit well.

Since spoiled food can't easily be replaced, be extra careful about
contamination and ripening. Seal well foods that must be refrigerated
and put them back quickly after use. Obviously, don't put fingers or
used utensils into condiments and sliced meats or drink directly from
containers. Eat the ripest fruit and vegetables first, and keep the
rest stored with good ventillation and protected from bruising. Don't
take larger portions than you plan to eat. If everyone doesn't finish
everything that was prepared, store the untouched leftovers for the
next snack or lunch instead of discarding them.

It is polite for someone other than the cook to wash the dishes.
However, on some boats the cook doesn't want anyone else in the galley
or handling their pots. When washing up, be conscious of water
consumption. The two sink (or sink and washtub) method of soaking in
soapy water and only rinsing in running water is preferred for water
conservation. Some boats have a salt water tap for pre-rinsing and
only use fresh water for the final rinse.


Setting Expectations
===================================================================

Some points to be aware of in setting expectations for boat interiors
when looking at images and videos compared to actually living on the boats.

Length
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Around 40' of length is where boat accommodations start to feel
spacious, with standing headroom, second heads, and wide
cabins. 

Unfortunately, 40' is also about the size where moorage and maintenance costs
get noticably higher, single-handing becomes tricky, and docking
maneuvers are decidedly more challenging in tight quarters and wind.
Except for the dock fees, it isn't so much about the length. An older
boat such as the Valiant 42 or even a 2010 Jeanneau 40' can be
fine for single handing. The issue is that newer boats are wide (beam)
and high (freeboard) to provide those nice spacious
accommodations. When sailing, that leads to a lot of mass to control
and a lot more footprint to squeeze between other boats and finger
docks. 

A small amount of length can make a large difference on a modern
yacht. On paper, a 38' and 40' boat sound like they are similar, and
they may look similar from the outside. However, consider two
factors. First, the interior space increases with the _cube_ of the
length, because a longer boat today is usually a wider and taller one
as well. Second, there is constant overhead for the technical spaces
and galley, and the saloon is usually long enough to fit a berth.
That means that the public spaces might be nearly the same size across
a 30' and 40' boat, and the extra space on the larger boat is going
into the cabins and heads.

Also beware that the length of a boat is hard to judge from
specifications.  The Length Over All (LOA) is what I've been quoting
here. That includes the bowsprit and potential overhangs at bow and
stern, so is not directly indicative of the space for interior
accommodations. Combine it with the Length of the Water Line (LWL) and
the beam to get a better sense of how much space there may be.  The
numbers in the names of boats are indicative but not definitive as
well. A boat called "38" or "388" is probably about 38', but
this is just a marketing model number and not a specification.
For example, the Dufour 37 is 35' LOA (smaller than the name implies) and the
Island Packet 439 is 47' LOA (larger than the name implies).

For private ownership by a short handed couple or solo sailor,
being a bit more conservative with a 30' or 35' cruiser could be more
practical than a 40' or 45' boat, as well as about half the price and
maintenance cost. Dropping below 40' means giving up that full-beam
owner's cabin and the extra large head compartment, and possibly
foregoing standing headroom in the cabins as well. From the other
perspective, adding just a bit more length may pay off in much better
accomodations. 

So, if you can afford it, it is probably worthwhile to size charter
boats in gentler waters (such as the Carribean) slightly larger than
your first instinct. And if you can tolerate it, it is worthwhile to
choose as a private boat one that is a bit smaller than first seems
attractive. It is no surprise given this advice that the most popular
coastal cruising sailboat sizes are 45' for charters and 36' for
privately owned sailboats.


Photographs Can Mislead
--------------------------------------------------------------

Boat interiors in marketing materials are almost always shown through
wide angle lens photographs, with no people in the frame. This is
probably not intended to be too deceptive; given the cramped
conditions, it is hard to get a shot where you can actually see the
space with a longer lens and people in the way. However, it means that
the spaces are a lot narrower than the images present in the wide
angle. The lack of scale of a standing adult can be misleading about
overall size, as berths, toilets, settees, and most boat fittings are
on a total overall scale smaller than in houses.

As with houses staged for sale in real estate listings, boats in
brochures and at shows are empty with only token flowers and dishware
set out to catch the eye. In use, there will be gear crammed
everywhere and everything secured.  Settees will have jackets and
lifepreservers on them. The shower may have fenders hanging in it when
day sailing and the foredeck covered by a dinghy for a passage.
Obviously, when living aboard with children there will be books and
toys everywhere.

Keeping an eye on the overhead layout as well as the nice photographs
helps calibrate for how large a space really is. The only real metric
that matters is getting on board the boat, of course. Boat shows
are a great way to quickly get a feel for a wide range of new boats
and understand how those diagrams and photos translate to real life.

Sailing Properties
------------------------------------------------------

In this article, I grouped and discussed boats based on their
accommodations, not their performance or bluewater sea-worthiness. A
sailboat can be a great home, but is hopefully also foremost a
sailboat and not a houseboat. See my
[Cruising Sailboats](../cruisers/index.md.html) article for a
discussion of those other properties.

<!--
Other Types
==============================================================

"Mid-sized" covers monohulls from about 25' to 60'. That is the size
where it is practical and financially conceivable for a wide range of
people to live aboard them. Boats within this size range tend to
follow a similar plan, growing the space per room and maybe adding
extra bathrooms as the boats get larger. There are some notable
exceptions to that common plan that I'll call out throughout this
article.


This article focussed on mid-sized monohulls as the most common case,
and one which is also the most easy to generalize about. *Catamarans*
have very different, vastly larger living spaces than this common
monohull plan. I also have less experience with them, as a primarily
monohull sailor. This is not to say that you shouldn't be very
interested in them. Catamarans are often luxurious even at 35'. Few
people would choose a monohull over a catamaran if their primary
consideration was quality of life at a sheltered anchorage. Outside of
that case (which is indeed common for chartering!), there are various
tradeoffs of catamarans vs. monohulls.

The accommodations of boats below 25' are more like sail lockers with a cot
and table, if they have accommodations at all. So, they once again
differ strongly from the common case discussed here. That said, it is
_possible_ and potentially cozy to cruise an appropriately configured
20' boat, but it won't resemble anything described in this article.
