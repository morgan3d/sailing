Preparing beforehand:

1. Check the prevailing wind forecast for the next 24-48 hours.
1. Read the pilot book for the anchorage
1. Ask someone with recent experience there if possible
1. Look at a satellite photo. Are there moorings? Navigation buoys?
1. Look at the whole anchorage at maximum magnification on your chart.
   Are there underwater hazards? Reefs? Cables? No-anchor zones?
   Marked mooring buoys? Where are there large regions of reasonable
   anchoring depth? 
1. Pick out a few spots where you might want to anchor.
   - Protected from wind and waves in multiple directions
   - No underwater hazards
   - Not blocking channel
   - Swing circle is clear of hazards (figure roughly 5x or more the depth, depending 
     on how high tides)
   - Far enough from shore that you can let out more rode if you
     need to
1. Check the tide chart for the lowest tide in the next 24-48 hours
   (you might end up staying longer than you expected). Note negative
   tides that will push the depth shallower than the chart data
1. Check the sunset time and arrive well before it so that you can see
   clearly. At a popular anchorage, by noon the good spots will
   be taken so you should arrive much earlier.
1. Complete the anchor worksheet. Note especially the minimum depth
   gauge reading that is safe at anchor time, the target depth gauge
   reading, and how much rode to put out.

Anchoring:

1. When you arrive at the anchorage, drive around the spots you
   previously picked out. 
   - Watch the depth gauge as you circle the 
     whole area in which you might swing, and make sure that at low
     tide you'll still have plenty of depth under the keel. Don't trust
     the chart.
   - If you're in clear water and have crew, have them stand on the
     bow looking down to scope out reefs and other hazards
1. Look at the other boats. 
   - Which way are they pointing? 
   - Are there other boats with similar type (sail vs. power, windage,
     size = likely draft)?  Prefer anchoring near to them because
     you'll swing in the same ways.
   - Do any of the boats make you feel uneasy? Poorly maintained,
     raucous, obviously charters, inappropriately large for the
     anchorage, etc? Anchor far from them. They're more likely to drag
     or be inconsiderate. 
   - Are they anchored with stern ties or a second anchor? If so,
     you must do the same. Whomever is first in the anchorage sets
     the standard and everyone else must follow to swing in the same way.
   - If the anchorage is crowded, ask people how much rode they have
     out or where their anchor is. That will tell you what their swing
     circle is and help you avoid fouling them when you drop your
     anchor.
1. Come to a stop a bit downwind of your chosen spot and put the
   engine in neutral. Note how the wind and current affect the boat
   when not under power.
1. Drive slightly upwind (or up current) of your chosen spot and
   back the engine to stop. If you're solo, lock the wheel.
1. Go to the foredeck with:
   - Winch handle
   - Boathook
   - Snubber
   - Phone/Tablet with anchor alarm
   - Headset (if not solo)
1. Release the clutch gently so that the anchor falls away at a rapid
   but safe speed. Do not use the windlass motor--it is too slow and
   annoys everyone.
1. Stop the clutch at 1.5-2.0x the current depth (which is more than
   the depth gauge reading because of the offset and the boat's freeboard).
   The idea is to let the anchor hit bottom with a bit of extra chain
   so that it can dig in but not get tangled.
1. Let the boat drift backwards. If there is no wind or current, briefly back
   the motor to initiate some movement. When you see that the chain is starting
   to stretch away and not hang straight down, start the anchor alarm.
1. Let out more rode until you've almost reached the target ratio.
1. Tighten the windlass clutch hard.
1. Gradually back the motor until the boat is pulling against the chain
   and stops moving. Increase to 2500 RPM.
1. Take a transit (line up a close thing on shore and a distant thing).
   Watch for 30 seconds. Are they moving relative to each other? If so,
   you're dragging. If not, your anchor is set.
1. Put the engine in neutral. The weight of the chain will pull the boat
   forward towards the anchor again.
1. Tie on the snubbers. Let out rode until the snubbers are taking
   the force and the chain is hanging down.
1. Shut off the engine and sit in the cockpit for a while, verifying that
   you are not dragging.
1. Watch other boats anchoring. If they anchor poorly near you, be
   prepared to monitor them all night and consider warning them or
   moving.  Leave a roving fender and boat hook ready if you suspect
   someone might drag onto you.
1. Put the halyard on a rail or tie it back with a bungee so it won't 
   bang.
1. Bring in your national flag.
1. Turn on the anchor light. Consider putting lanterns at the bow and
   stern or lighting the decks if you are anchored somewhere unusual or
   expect traffic in the dark.
1. As the sun goes down, look out through your cabin hatch or the companionway.
   Note what the other boats and shore landmarks look like in the dark.


Note that we turn on the anchor alarm not when we drop but after the
anchor touches bottom. This is because the boat will likely drift
about half a boat length while the anchor is falling and first
dragging on the bottom. We use a mobile device instead of plotter so
that we can shut off power to instruments and look at it while in our
berth at night. We set the alarm from the bow instead of the stern
because the stern is a long distance in an arbitrary direction from
where the anchor actually hits. If anchoring in 3m of water on a 12m
long boat, setting the anchor alarm at the stern is going to double
the apparent swing circle and mislead us about where the anchor
actually is.

If something is going wrong and you're in rough conditions or drifting
towards other boats or lose power or tangle the prop, just let out a
bunch of rode to about 3x the current depth. You don't need the
perfect holding ratio at first. You just need to stop the boat and let
the anchor dig in a bit. You can let out more rode once everything settles down.



Throughout the night, every few hours:

1. Check the anchor alarm history to see how you're
   swinging. 
1. Look out through the hatch and make sure you understand what you
   see in terms of anchor lights and silhouettes. None should be getting
   closer.
1. Be aware of the motion of the boat and sound of water and wind. If it
   changes substantially, look out of the hatch and check the conditions.
1. If you hear any unusual sound, check it out. There should not be strange
   banging, grinding, creaking, fans, hissing, beeping, etc. Any of those might be
   a sign of a system on the boat failing, something drifting into the boat,
   the boat drifting into something else, or the boat starting to ground on a 
   rock.
