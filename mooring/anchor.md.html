This describes the common case of using a single anchor under
reasonable weather conditions in a protected anchorage. Despite many
boater's approach, there's a lot more work to this than driving in,
pressing the windlass down button, and cracking open a few
beers. Fortunately, that work becomes second nature quickly with
practice. It pays off with safe, restful nights.

Other techniques you should be aware of that are not covered
here include:

- Shore tying the stern, a common practice in my area
- Dual front "Bermuda" anchoring (which I've never seen done)
- Bow and stern anchoring
- Hurricane preparation 
- Med mooring off an anchor, a common practice in...the Med


Research
------------------------------------------

1. Check the prevailing wind forecast for the next 24-48 hours.
   Anchoring in the lee of a large object is usually best. Beware that
   in some places strong winds will sweep down hills or funnel between
   buildings. Regardless, prefer to be blown away from shore, not
   towards it. The lee of a hill, island, reef, or breakwater will
   protect you from waves and make for a quiet night.
1. Read the pilot book for the anchorage.
1. Ask someone with recent experience there if possible.
1. Look at a satellite photo. Are there mooring buoys you can use? Mooring
   buoys you can't use? Navigation buoys? Log booms? Giant rocks
   not shown on your chart?
1. Look at the whole anchorage at maximum magnification on your chart.
   Are there underwater hazards? Reefs? Cables? No-anchor zones?
   Marked mooring buoys? Where are there large regions of reasonable
   anchoring depth?
1. Pick out a few spots where you might want to anchor.
   - Protected from wind and waves in multiple directions
   - No underwater hazards
   - Not blocking channel
   - Swing circle is clear of hazards (figure roughly 5x or more the depth, depending 
     on how high tides)
   - Far enough from shore that you can let out more rode if you
     need to
1. Check the tide chart for the lowest tide in the next 24-48 hours
   (you might end up staying longer than you expected). Note negative
   tides that will push the depth shallower than the chart data!
1. Check the sunset time and plan to arrive well before it, so that
   you can see clearly. At a popular anchorage, by noon the good spots
   will be taken, so you should arrive very early.
1. Re-evaluate whether this is the right anchorage for tonight, and
   consider alternatives. If traveling a long distance today,
   have a few backup plans even if you like the anchorage because
   you might not reach it.
1. Complete the anchor worksheet. Note especially the minimum depth
   gauge reading that is safe at anchor time, the target depth gauge
   reading, and how much rode to put out.


Anchoring
------------------------------------------------

1. When you arrive at the anchorage, drive around the spots you
   previously picked out. Trust your real-time observations
   and intuition over your research.
   - Watch the depth gauge as you circle the whole area in which you
     might swing, and make sure that at low tide you'll still have
     plenty of depth under the keel. Don't trust the chart.
   - If you're in clear water and have crew, have them stand on the
     bow looking down to scope out reefs and other hazards.
   - If it is low tide, you can see many more hazards and if you run
     aground while anchoring you will come off shortly. Anchoring on a
     rising low tide is ideal but this isn't something you can usually
     control.
   - If it is high tide, beware that (a) you can't see a lot of things,
     and (b) your swing will bring you much closer to shore when the tide
     falls. Your horizontal rode distance will increase _and_ the shore
     will come closer.
1. Look at the other boats. 
   - Which way are they pointing? Are they all pointing in the same
     direction? When both wind and current are significant, boats
     diverge.
   - Are there other boats with similar type (sail vs. power, windage,
     size = likely draft)? Prefer anchoring near to them because
     you'll swing at similar times and in similar directions.
   - Do any of the boats make you feel uneasy? Poorly maintained, no
     snubber out, raucous, obviously charters, inappropriately large
     for the anchorage, etc.? Anchor far from them and ideally
     upwind/up current. They're more likely to drag in the night or be
     inconsiderate.
   - Are they anchored with stern ties or a second anchor? If so,
     you must do the same. Whomever is first in the anchorage sets
     the standard and everyone else must follow to swing in the same way.
   - If the anchorage is crowded, ask people how much rode they have
     out or where their anchor is. That will tell you what their swing
     circle is and help you avoid fouling them when you drop your
     anchor.
   - If others are giving you mean glares, you're probably too close
     to them to anchor (or they are jerks, or both)
1. Put the snubber and boathook on the foredeck in a secure location
   and where they won't trip anyone. Open the anchor locker and 
   clip it up so that it stays open.
1. Pick a spot! If the water is more than a few meters deep and there's
   some wind or current, beware that the place your boat sits will
   be a ways downwind/current from where you drop. If you are next to another boat
   when you drop, you will end up (usually desirably) far downwind
   from them once anchored. If you are upwind of another boat when you drop
   you will end up (usually undesirably) right on them once anchored,
   and probably foul their anchor line.
1. Come to a stop a bit downwind of your chosen spot to drop and put
   the engine in neutral. Note how the wind and current affect the
   boat when not under power. You'll need to know this in a moment.
1. Drive slightly upwind (or up current) of your chosen spot and
   back the engine to stop. If you're solo, lock the wheel.
1. Go to the foredeck with:
   
   - Winch handle
   - Boathook
   - Snubber line
   - Phone/Tablet with anchor alarm
   - Headset (if not solo)
   
   Beware that someone on the bow won't be able to hear someone at the 
   stern shouting. The distance, windlass sound, and engine
   sound make this impossible. Use a headset and have a pre-determined
   set of hand signals. 
   
1. Let the boat start drifting backwards or give it a tiny burst of
   reverse throttle if there is no wind or current at all.
1. Release the clutch gently so that the anchor falls away at a rapid
   but safe speed. Do not use the windlass motor to drop--it is too slow and
   annoys everyone.
1. Stop the clutch at 1.5-2.0x the current depth (which is more than
   the depth gauge reading because of the offset and the boat's freeboard).
   The idea is to let the anchor hit bottom with a bit of extra chain
   so that it can dig in but not get tangled.
1. Let the boat drift backwards. If there is no wind or current, briefly back
   the motor to initiate some movement. When you see that the chain is starting
   to stretch away and not hang straight down, start the anchor alarm.
1. Let out more rode until you've almost reached the target ratio.
1. Tighten the windlass clutch hard.
1. Gradually back the motor until the boat is pulling against the chain
   and stops moving. Increase to 2500 RPM and hold.
1. Take a transit (line up a close thing on shore and a distant
   thing). Watch for 30 seconds. Are the points you chose moving
   relative to each other? If so, you're dragging. If not, your anchor
   is set. If you can't see two points on shore at different distances
   (such as when anchored under a cliff), compare a point on the boat and 
   one on shore and wait until the boat straightens fully before comparing.
1. Put the engine in neutral. The weight of the chain will pull the boat
   forward towards the anchor again.
1. I've heard people claim that in warm, clear water, they dive on
   their anchor to verify it is set and see how the chain lies on the
   bottom.  It sounds like a good idea, especially if you know a storm
   is coming.  Yet, I have never personally seen anyone else do this
   at an anchorage and have never done it myself.
1. Tie on the snubbers. Let out rode until the snubbers are taking
   the force and the chain is hanging down. For light conditions,
   one short snubber is fine. In medium conditions, a 5m snubber on 
   each side of the boat will keep you more comfortable and reduce
   boat strain and jerks on the anchor. For windy or wavy conditions, 10m
   or more with strain relief might be needed.
1. Shut off the engine, lock the wheel straight, and sit in the
   cockpit for a while, verifying that you are not dragging.
1. Watch other boats anchoring after you. If they anchor poorly near
   you, be prepared to monitor them all night and consider warning
   them or moving. Leave a roving fender and boat hook ready if you
   suspect someone might drag onto you.
1. Put the halyard on a rail or tie it back with a bungee so it won't 
   clang at night. Cover the mainsail. Bring in your national flag.
1. Turn on the anchor light. Turn off your navigation lights.
   Consider putting lanterns at the bow and stern or lighting the
   decks if you are anchored somewhere unusual or expect traffic in
   the dark.
1. As the sun goes down, look out through your cabin hatch or the
   companionway. Note what the other boats and shore landmarks look
   like in the dark so that you'll later be oriented and know what
   it looks like when everything is good.


Night Monitoring
-----------------------------------------
Periodically throughout the night:

1. Check the anchor alarm history to see how you're swinging. 
1. Look out through the hatch and make sure you understand what you
   see in terms of anchor lights and silhouettes. None should be getting
   closer.
1. Be aware of the motion of the boat and sound of water and wind. If it
   changes substantially, look out of the hatch and check the conditions.
1. If you hear any unusual sound, check it out. There should not be
   strange banging, grinding, creaking, fans running, hissing,
   beeping, etc. Any of those might be a sign of a system on the boat
   failing, something drifting into the boat, the boat drifting into
   something else, or the boat starting to ground on a rock.


Equipment
=============================================================

Headset
----------------------------------------

When anchoring and not solo, we've found short-range hands free (i.e.,
not push-to-talk) headsets invaluable. The headsets allow normal
volume, calm conversation. These are inexpensive and don't have to be
great quality. You are not very far apart and can use hand signals.

When dropping anchor there isn't much to discuss. The helm decides
where to drop, and when the boat starts drifting backwards the
foredeck crew lets the anchor go.

When retrieving an anchor or catching a mooring ball, it is very
helpful for the foredeck crew to give orders to the helm via the
headset.

The foredeck crew must be the one in charge (once the anchor drop
location is determined). The foredeck person is the one with the
clearest view of what is going on. If you have an inexperienced crew,
go to the foredeck yourself and put the crew on the helm or anchor as
if solo. 


Snubber
---------------------------------------

My go-to snubber is a 10m three brain nylon line. It has a spliced
loop at one and and a rubber strain relief at the other. I prefer
nylon because it stretches more than poly.

I put the loop on the midship cleat, run the line along the deck and
through a bow eye, and then tie it to the anchor chain with an icicle
hitch. I have sized it for my boat so that the knot hangs just above the
water when deployed.

I do the same on the other side to form a bridle in all but the most
settled conditions.

There are many advantages of running the snubber this way, versus cleating
it at the bow and letting out line into the water:

- The fixed, worst-case length makes it easy to deploy
- The long line over the deck provides plenty of strain relief
- If I need to let out more scope, I only have to pull in two meters
  of chain, not the entire long snubber
- The snubber stays out of the water, so it is clean and dry when
  retrieved and stays supple for tying on

If I need more than 10m of snubber for strain relief, then I probably
have all of my chain out and am on my rope rode anyway, so don't need
more relief via the snubber itself. However, I do still tie a snubber
to take the force off the windlass.


Rode
----------------------------------------

I use 50m of chain with 50m of rope. I think an all-chain rode
is overkill for normal coastal cruising. I rarely go past
the 50m of chain (although frequently use all of the chain).

An all-chain rode would put a lot of mass in my bow and exceed
my windlass' ability to recover. The purposes of chain are to
weigh down the rode so that the anchor experiences horizontal
pull, and to protect the rode from chafing on sharp objects
on the bottom. So, you definitely want some chain. But beyond
50m those advantages are negligible. The strain relief of rope
is more advantageous after 50m than more weight.

If I were cruising in stormy regions, preparing for a hurricane,
or high lattitudes I would consider multiple anchors on longer
chain rodes.

There are some places where having more than 100m would be helpful.
When anchoring to hold ground against current when underway or
spending the night fjord-like areas, a long chain and a stern tie may
be needed. I'd tie my backup anchor's rode or all of the docking lines
to the regular anchor line if I had to. I've met several people who did
this for offshore races to hold ground in a deep strait against
a storm or strong current. Be ready to spend a long time recovering
that anchor, I guess.

I mark the chain at 5m, 10m, and then every 10m afterward
with multiple plastic pieces embedded in the links. I use
rainbow colors with the red end for shallow and the blue
end for deep.

I put a laminated printed color guide on the inside of the chain
locker and at the navdesk (which I carry to the helm).

Other people swear by colored zip ties or painting the chain
itself.

Anchor Alarm
----------------------------------------

### Devices

I use Anchor Pro on an iPad or iPhone as my anchor alarm. Only
iPads with cellular modems have GPS. You do not need the cellular
service enabled on iPad or iPhone.

Android phones and tablets as of 2025 cannot maintain continuous GPS
tracking when the phone display is off, so can't be used as an anchor
alarm. This is a misguided power-saving feature.

There are dedicated anchor alarm devices that can be purchased at
various price points. Many of these are more expensive than an old
iPad or iPhone.

Almost every chart plotter has an anchor alarm on it. I avoid using
these. A mobile device has many advantages. It enables you to:

- Shut off power to instruments to save the battery
- Check the boat's position and drag history--and hear the alarm!--from your berth
- Track the position of the bow instead of wherever the boat's GPS
  is centered


### Use

I do not set the anchor alarm right when we drop the anchor from the
boat. I set it after the anchor touches bottom. This is because the
boat drifts half a boat length or more while the anchor is falling and
first dragging on the bottom. I want an accurate center for the alarm
so I can set a reasonably tight alarm radius.

I set the alarm from the bow instead of the stern because the stern is
a long distance in an arbitrary direction from where the anchor
actually hits. If anchoring in 3m of water on a 12m long boat, setting
the anchor alarm at the stern is going to double the apparent swing
circle and mislead me about where the anchor actually is. If I'm
sleeping in the forward cabin, this will also give me the most
accurate reading on the anchor alarm during the night.


Temporary Anchoring
-----------------------------------

Sometimes I don't have time to prepare and know that I'm in reasonably
deep water with a clear swing radius and gentle conditions.  Or I'm
stopping for lunch or a repair, and won't leave the boat or go to
sleep.

In this case, check the chart for obstructions and then just drop
until the anchor hits bottom.

Let out a bunch of rode, maybe twice again what it took to hit the
bottom. and wait until the anchor starts to bite. At this point, the
boat attached to ground. There's plenty of time to do whatever was
planned. Or if staying for the night, plenty of time to figure out if
it is a good spot and how much rode is actually needed.


Emergency Anchoring
--------------------------------------------

In an emergency, just let the anchor fly and stop the windlass when
there's 3x what you expect the current depth to be. Some cases where
that's important:

- You're in rough conditions and can't safely anchor carefully until
  it calms down.
- Drifting towards other boats without power or with a tangled prop,
  in a marina or anchorage
- Off a lee shore and can't make headway away from it
- Stuck in strong current and moving backwards
- There's an emergency on board, but you're too close to shore to
  ignore the helm and deal with it without stopping the boat.

If you're always prepared, you can go from the helm to the foredeck
safely and have the anchor down in maybe a minute. Prepared means
knowing how to manually release the clutch, having a winch handle
ready, and always keeping the anchor ready to launch. (I do keep the
anchor clipped on with a short snubber at all times when it isn't
down, but releasing that snubber by unclipping or cutting it takes
no time.)

In this emergency anchor drop case, the boat is already moving. The
rode won't pile on the anchor and you don't have time to feel for the
bottom and set the anchor properly anyway. Stopping the boat is your
primary goal in this case, not setting up the perfect holding for the
night.

I keep a backup anchor on its rode in a cockpit locker ready to go at
all times. This anchor has an all rope rode and the rode is coiled
into two buckets with the bitter end hanging out. If the primary
anchor fails in a tense situation, this backup can be tied off to a
cleat and thrown overboard in a few minutes. The backup anchor is also
what I'd use if I have to stern anchor to prevent a swing. 

I keep a third anchor without its own rode also stored at the bottom
of the cockpit locker. (I'd prefer to put it out of the way under the
V berth but it doesn't fit.) I'd use this if I have to cut the primary
or backup loose instead of retrieving it.
