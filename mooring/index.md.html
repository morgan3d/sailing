                         **Mooring and Anchoring**
                            Updated 2023-01-03

*Mooring* is attaching a boat to a permanent structure, such as a dock, piling,
or anchored mooring. The skills involved are maneuvering the boat to come to a 
stop at the right point, attaching it securely, and detaching and leaving
the mooring safely.

*Anchoring* is temporarily attaching a boat to the ground. The skills involved
are selecting a location, securing the anchor to the bottom and preparing
sufficient scope, and freeing and retrieving the anchor.

The two are sometimes combined, such as when *Mediterranean mooring* with a
bow anchor and stern to a dock, or *tying to shore* by combining an anchor
with one or more lines to rocks and trees.


Dinghies
============================================================================

Dry Sailing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sailing dinghies are typically *dry sailed*, meaning that they are
retrieved from the water after sailing.

The typical storage cases are:

- On a dolly (hand trailer)
- Pulled out of the water onto a dock
- Pulled onto a beach or lawn
- Carried from a car or trailer

Launching from a dolly is generally the easiest and best to avoid
damaging the boat's hull.

Notes on catamarans.

### Launching

Rig the boat with the centerboard and rudder raised. Leave the sail
controls (vang and sheet) loose. Check all of the rigging. Is the sail
at the top of the mast? Are all of the lines running clear and free
from wear? Are the battens in good shape? Is the main sheet running
through the block the correct way? And so on. 

Determine the wind direction and look for signs of how it changes
further out on the water. Look for boat traffic, swimmers,
obstructions in the water, and other factors that will affect your
navigation as and after you launch. Think about how you will later
land before you launch. Consider how the wind and tide may change by
then as well.  Do not leave shore before you have a plan for how to
return.

Move the boat into the water with the bow facing only a few degrees
off the wind.  Stay on the upwind side near the bow at all times so
that you can control the boat and are not hit by the boom. In strong
wind or any waves, ensure that this is also the sea side--never stand
between a boat and the shore or a dock.

Get deep enough to drop the centerboard and rudder partway. If using a 
daggerboard, ensure that it is far enough down to allow a tack.

If you have a dolly, quickly run it up the shore far enough that waves
and tide changes will not pull it in. If in waves, this is impossible
to do without a second person. Do not leave a boat unattended in
waves. It will capsize, smash into the bottom/shore, and potentially
injure someone as it sweeps in to shore. A small boat with a wave
behind it is a nearly unstoppable force.

Grab the main sheet and keep just enough tension to prevent the boom
from swinging wildly. Hop in the boat over the gunnel or the
stern. Quickly sheet in and steer off the wind. Drop and secure the
rudder and centerboard as soon as the water is deep enough. Watch for
sudden wind changes of strength or direction that often occur near
shore. Tighten the vang.

As soon as the water is at least shoulder deep, you have maneuvering
room, and are in relatively clear air, execute a tack in each
direction and then a gybe. This ensures that nothing is
tangled. Because dinghies are often partly rigged each time they are
launched, this rigging check is needed. It is easy to have the rudder
on the wrong side of a traveller or the vang wrapped around the
cunningham. If there is a rigging failure that will prevent you from
turning, then it is important to discover that quickly, while close to
shore. If there is a problem, return to knee deep water and fix it there.
You probably do not need to pull out of the water.

It is also important to execute the tack and gybe soon after entering
normal wind conditions to verify your understanding of the wind
direction and strength and sea state. If you have difficulty executing
a tack and gybe, the conditions are to challenging for you to sail
that day.

Finally, if you are sailing in an unfamiliar area, look back at shore
and memorize some landmarks so that you can find your landing spot
later.  Consider that cars and other boats may move, flags may be
lowered, and the sun will change before then, so pick landmarks that
will not be affected.

### Retrieval

Plan your landing well before returning to shore. Determine how you
will come in, where you will land, and fallback plans. Fallback plans
include what to do if another boat arrives first, if you miss your
desired landing, or if you have a capsize or equipment failure at the 
last moment.

If possible, raise the rudder and centerboard partway as you approach
shore. Be prepared to release the vang and mainsheet when it is time 
to depower the boat.

#### Dock 

If you have a choice of dock or a protected beach without waves,
choose the beach.

When landing at a dock, you must come to a stop with the boat facing
upwind. You cannot land downwind or the boat will be swept down the
dock. Do not run straight into the dock; always come alongside it in
whichever direction is facing upwind. If possible, land on the leeward
side of the dock so that the wind is pushing you away from the dock.

Release the sheet and vang when the boat is alongside the dock and
scamper out over the gunnel. Hold the mast or the painter. If your
boat has a halyard, drop the mainsail. Remove the rudder and raise the
centerboard completely. Get the boat out of the water as quickly as
possible. While on the dock in the water you are vulnerable to being
hit by another boat docking and are consuming valuable shared landing
space.

When the boat is alongside the dock, be careful that it does not slip
under the dock in waves or smash the underside of its gunnels on the
top of the dock. Both of these can quickly damage a boat as well as
any fingers caught between the two objects.

With experience you can learn to dock by stepping off your boat
directly onto the dock, holding the mast the entire time. This
requires balance and knowledge of how to steer well by only shifting
your weight, so don't attempt it until you are confident. It is better
to slide on your belly onto a dock like a novice than capsize next to
it like an idiot.


#### Protected Beach

A beach with at least partial protection from waves and wind is ideal
for landing a dinghy. You have much more maneuvering room than at a
dock and there is no hard object (except for rocks on the bottom) to
hit and damage your boat. 

At a beach you also have about 90 degrees of freedom in the exact
angle at which you stop, versus a dock where you must align upwind
with the dock itself.

As you approach the beach, raise the centerboard and rudder to the
same level as when you launched. If there is current or a strong
cross wind, make sure to aim "above" the point where you want to land
so that you will drift down to it. Ease the vang and prepare to ease
the main.

The preferred case is landing upwind. Tack in towards shore, point
the boat head to wind when in knee deep water, and jump out over
the side, maintaing a handhold. 

When you must land downwind, be very careful of an accidental gybe.
The wind often changes near shore and you will also be distracted
looking at the shoreline and down to judge the water depth. Come in a
broad reach if possible to avoid gybing. When you are at the desired
depth, quickly round up into the wind and jump out of the boat,
maintaining a handhold on the side.

Move to the bow and hold the boat from there. Stay on the sea side and
upwind, just as when launching. If you can drop your mainsail with a
halyard do so, and then raise the centerboard and remove the rudder.

If you have a dolly, quickly retrieve it, keeping an eye on the boat
the whole time. Pull the dolly to the boat (instead of the other way
around) and put the boat on the dolly, keeping the bow into the
wind. You may have to stand on the dolly to intentionally sink it
beneath the boat. Then bring the dolly to shore and pull it up with
the bow pointing towards shore. Go far enough up the shore that you
are safe from the reach of waves and then turn the boat into the wind
before derigging.

When landing in strong wind on a boat with a sock-style main, such as
a Laser, you can release the sail by freeing the main from the
block. This allows the sail to rotate around to the bow, which may be
necessary to control it if landing and retrieving downwind.

#### Unprotected Beach

Landing a dinghy on an unprotected beach with strong waves or wind is
challenging. 

If you don't care much about the condition of your hull, then you can
pull the daggerboard and rudder at the last moment and run it straight
onto the beach, getting out of the boat as soon as it is on shore to avoid
your weight driving it into the ground even harder. 

Even on sand this will scrape up the bottom horribly on a fiberglass
boat. On a rotomolded plastic boat it is probably OK unless landing on
rocks. The advantage of this landing method is that you are quickly on
shore and out of the dangerous region where waves break, _and_ it can
easily be executed by a solo sailor. If anything goes wrong with
another strategy, be aware of the beaching alternative and prepared to
use it.

When trying to protect your hull, instead come to a stop in the
deepest water where you think you can stand. Ideally this is deeper
than where waves are breaking, but that might not be possible.  Follow
the general preparation for landing on a protected beach.  If you have
a halyard, bring down the sail as quickly as possible and lash it to
the boom.  Otherwise, for a sock style sail release the main from the
block so that it can swing out freely, being careful that the
mainsheet is not whipping around.

Always stay on the sea side of the boat. If you lose control, let the
boat capsize and drive into shore, and then quickly drag it up the
beach from shore. Do not let the boat sit capsized in breaking waves 
for any period of time, and never let a person get between the boat
and shore.

Have a second person bring you the dolly, which must be able to float
for what I'm about to describe. Put the boat on the dolly in deep
water and if possible strap it down. Turn the boat stern-to the waves
and surf it quickly in to shore while you hold onto the side or stern.
Quickly pull the boat above the wave line and turn it into the wind
before derigging.

I have personally executed these retrieval methods in up to 20 kts of
wind and 1m waves on sandy and muddy beaches. 

I have heard of another method but never tried it myself. That method
is to use a mushroom anchor to leave a ball fender (a typical racing
mark) at about shoulder depth before launching. Then, on return, the
boat can be tied to this ball temporarily while a solo sailor gets
their own dinghy from shore.

### Docking

### Anchoring



Keel Boats
=============================================================================
Boats over 19 feet with ballasted keels usually have engines and
are anchored or moored between sailing sessions, although smaller ones
*trailer sailed* and retrieved with a trailer.

As with smaller boats, keel boats _can_ be moored and anchored under
sail (or sculling/rowing) and traditionally were. However, today's
marinas and anchorages are crowded and the boats are wider (beamier)
than they used to be, so it is now common and courtious to perform
these maneuvers under power whenever possible.

Keelboat docking needs to be approached with care and respect for the
risks. As with an airplane, the most difficult and dangerous parts of
operating a keelboat are when it is close to land and
obstructions. Crew and the skipper need to be extra careful and
vigilant to avoid the boat striking objects or any part of their
bodies being caught between the boat and another object.

Falling overboard when docking or undocking is even more dangerous
than while sailing, as there is a high risk of hitting a dock when
falling, striking a hard or sharp an underwater hazard, or becoming
trapped against a wall or vessel. (Marina water is also not
particularly clean and can have electrical currents propagating
through it.)


Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Parts of a Marina
A marina typically has a *breakwater* outer wall that protects it from
wind and waves, a wide main *fairway* (water road), narrower side fairways,
and *slips* in which one or two boats are stored off those side fairways.

*Fixed* docks maintain a constant elevation relative to the ground and
are either high or in non-tidal areas. *Floating* docks move vertically
with the water level, and may provide less steady footing. *Fingers* are
very narrow docks between sets of boats and can be extremely unsteady 
footing. 

*Pilings* are strong poles driven into the ground. They may support
fixed docks from beneath, the sides of floating docks to keep them in
place, provide places to attach lines away from the dock, or provide
fence-like structures for prohibiting crossing areas and partial
protection from waves and wind.

Regular navigation rules apply within a marina. This includes passing
vessels on opposing tacks to starboard (your port sides face each
other; "drive on the right side of the road") and giving way to
unpowered vessels such as canoes. Marinas can also impose their own
navigation rules. An overtaking vessel has to give way, and passing
from behind within a marina is never done. In general, it is tight
quarters and taking all care to avoid collisions and compromising
another boat's maneuverability is the norm.


### Considerations

The considerations based on the location when docking and undocking
are:

- Direction of approach/exit, and room to maneuver
  - Side docking
  - Slip with another boat
  - Private slip
- Mooring side relative to prop walk
- Water current relative to approach and side
- Wind relative to approach and side

There are considerations based on the type of boat. A boat will handle
differently and present options based on its windage, drive type,
propeller characteristics, the presence of thrusters, and whether it
is has single or dual rudders.

Docking while shorthanded or singlehanded can require special
techniques. All keelboat docking under power requires careful
planning. The crew must be briefed on the plan, the lines and fenders
prepared, and the skipper have multiple backup plans if something
fails.

Above 35 feet the mass and windage of the boat is such that it is no
longer an option to use human brute force to start or stop boat motion
or hold the boat off the dock and other vessels. Careful manipulation
of forces is required. 

The engine/propeller is only one force available. Large boat docking
maneuvers involve active use of fenders and lines to pull and press on
the boat. These are not just for protection and fastening to the dock.


Maneuvering Under Power
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats generally require some forward or backward
motion relative to the water to have steerage. Generally, one uses
enough speed to have steerage and maintain way versus the current and
wind and no more when maneuvering within a marina. For example,
keeping speed low enough to produce no wake and be able to stop
quickly (less than 5 kts) when in main fairway and extremely slow (1-2
kts) when in a secondary fairway and docking.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. On a
single lever, it should be moved into neutral, and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.
  
A boat with strong prop walk is able to back and fill
