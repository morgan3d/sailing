                         **Mooring and Anchoring**
                            Updated 2023-01-03

*Mooring* is attaching a boat to a permanent structure, such as a dock, piling,
or anchored mooring. The skills involved are maneuvering the boat to come to a 
stop at the right point, attaching it securely, and detaching and leaving
the mooring safely.

*Anchoring* is temporarily attaching a boat to the ground. The skills involved
are selecting a location, securing the anchor to the bottom and preparing
sufficient scope, and freeing and retrieving the anchor.

The two are sometimes combined, such as when *Mediterranean mooring* with a
bow anchor and stern to a dock, or *tying to shore* by combining an anchor
with one or more lines to rocks and trees.

_Launching and landing are the most dangerous aspects of recreational
sailing. Improper mooring and anchoring endanger your boat and other
vessels. As with all of the notes in this series, I'm collecting
publicly available information here and adding my experience, but not
vouching for the accuracy or applicability of any of this information
for your own sailing. Confirm everything with other sources, local
experts, and your own experimentation. My personal experience in
mooring and anchoring large boats is limited._

Keel Boats
=============================================================================
Boats over 19 feet with ballasted keels usually have engines and
are anchored or moored between sailing sessions, although smaller ones
*trailer sailed* and retrieved with a trailer.

As with smaller boats, keel boats _can_ be moored and anchored under
sail (or sculling/rowing) and traditionally were. However, today's
marinas and anchorages are crowded and the boats are wider (beamier)
than they used to be, so it is now common and courtious to perform
these maneuvers under power whenever possible.

Keelboat docking needs to be approached with care and respect for the
risks. As with an airplane, the most difficult and dangerous parts of
operating a keelboat are when it is close to land and
obstructions. Crew and the skipper need to be extra careful and
vigilant to avoid the boat striking objects or any part of their
bodies being caught between the boat and another object.

Falling overboard when docking or undocking is even more dangerous
than while sailing, as there is a high risk of hitting a dock when
falling, striking a hard or sharp an underwater hazard, or becoming
trapped against a wall or vessel. (Marina water is also not
particularly clean and can have electrical currents propagating
through it.)

If you have a tender, ensure that it is lifted out of the water,
affixed firmly alongside the mothership, or on a short painter while
docking and anchoring. It is important to not hit other boats with the
dinghy or catch its tow line and bridle in the mothership's propeller.

Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Parts of a Marina
A marina typically has a *breakwater* outer wall that protects it from
wind and waves, a wide main *fairway* (water road), narrower side fairways,
and *slips* in which one or two boats are stored off those side fairways.

*Fixed* docks maintain a constant elevation relative to the ground and
are either high or in non-tidal areas. *Floating* docks move vertically
with the water level, and may provide less steady footing. *Fingers* are
very narrow docks between sets of boats and can be extremely unsteady 
footing. 

*Pilings* are strong poles driven into the ground. They may support
fixed docks from beneath, the sides of floating docks to keep them in
place, provide places to attach lines away from the dock, or provide
fence-like structures for prohibiting crossing areas and partial
protection from waves and wind.

Regular navigation rules apply within a marina. This includes passing
vessels on opposing tacks to starboard (your port sides face each
other; "drive on the right side of the road") and giving way to
unpowered vessels such as canoes. Marinas can also impose their own
navigation rules. An overtaking vessel has to give way, and passing
from behind within a marina is never done. In general, it is tight
quarters and taking all care to avoid collisions and compromising
another boat's maneuverability is the norm.


### Considerations

The considerations based on the location when docking and undocking
are:

- Direction of approach/exit, and room to maneuver
  - Side docking
  - Slip with another boat
  - Private slip
- Mooring side relative to prop walk
- Water current relative to approach and side
- Wind relative to approach and side

There are considerations based on the type of boat. A boat will handle
differently and present options based on its windage, drive type,
propeller characteristics, the presence of thrusters, and whether it
is has single or dual rudders.

Docking while shorthanded or singlehanded can require special
techniques. All keelboat docking under power requires careful
planning. The crew must be briefed on the plan, the lines and fenders
prepared, and the skipper have multiple backup plans if something
fails.

Above 35 feet the mass and windage of the boat is such that it is no
longer an option to use human brute force to start or stop boat motion
or hold the boat off the dock and other vessels. Careful manipulation
of forces is required. 

The engine/propeller is only one force available. Large boat docking
maneuvers involve active use of fenders and lines to pull and press on
the boat. These are not just for protection and fastening to the dock.


Maneuvering Under Power
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats generally require some forward or backward
motion relative to the water to have steerage. Generally, one uses
enough speed to have steerage and maintain way versus the current and
wind and no more when maneuvering within a marina. For example,
keeping speed low enough to produce no wake and be able to stop
quickly (less than 5 kts) when in main fairway and extremely slow (1-2
kts) when in a secondary fairway and docking.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. On a
single lever, it should be moved into neutral, and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.
