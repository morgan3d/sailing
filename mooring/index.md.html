                         **Mooring and Anchoring**
                            Updated 2023-01-03

*Mooring* is attaching a boat to a permanent structure, such as a dock, piling,
or anchored mooring. The skills involved are maneuvering the boat to come to a 
stop at the right point, attaching it securely, and detaching and leaving
the mooring safely.

*Anchoring* is temporarily attaching a boat to the ground. The skills involved
are selecting a location, securing the anchor to the bottom and preparing
sufficient scope, and freeing and retrieving the anchor.

The two are sometimes combined, such as when *Mediterranean mooring* with a
bow anchor and stern to a dock, or *tying to shore* by combining an anchor
with one or more lines to rocks and trees.

_Improper mooring and anchoring endanger your boat, other vessels, and
the crews on them. As with all of the notes in this series, I'm
collecting publicly available information here and adding my
experience, but not vouching for the accuracy or applicability of any
of this information for your own sailing. Confirm everything with
other sources, local experts, and your own experimentation. Be aware
of your environment and conditions and adapt your techniques
appropriately. My personal experience in mooring and anchoring large
boats is limited._

Docking
======================================================================

Boats over 19 feet with ballasted keels usually have engines and are
anchored or moored between sailing sessions, although smaller ones
can be *trailer sailed* and retrieved with a trailer.

As with smaller boats, keel boats _can_ be moored and anchored under
sail (or sculling/rowing) and traditionally were. However, today's
marinas and anchorages are crowded and the boats are wider (beamier)
than they used to be, so it is now common and courtious to perform
these maneuvers under power whenever possible.

Keelboat docking needs to be approached with care and respect for the
risks. As with an airplane, the most difficult and dangerous parts of
operating a keelboat are when it is close to land and
obstructions. Crew and the skipper need to be extra careful and
vigilant to avoid the boat striking objects or any part of their
bodies being caught between the boat and another object.

Falling overboard when docking or undocking is even more dangerous
than while sailing, as there is a high risk of hitting a dock when
falling, striking a hard or sharp an underwater hazard, or becoming
trapped against a wall or vessel. (Marina water is also not
particularly clean and can have electrical currents propagating
through it.)

If you have a tender, ensure that it is lifted out of the water,
affixed firmly alongside the mothership, or on a short painter while
docking and anchoring. It is important to not hit other boats with the
dinghy or catch its tow line and bridle in the mothership's propeller.

Parts of a Marina
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A marina typically has a *breakwater* outer wall that protects it from
wind and waves, a wide main *fairway* (water road), narrower side fairways,
and *slips* in which one or two boats are stored off those side fairways.

*Fixed* docks maintain a constant elevation relative to the ground and
are either high or in non-tidal areas. *Floating* docks move vertically
with the water level, and may provide less steady footing. *Fingers* are
very narrow docks between sets of boats and can be extremely unsteady 
footing. 

*Pilings* are strong poles driven into the ground. They may support
fixed docks from beneath, the sides of floating docks to keep them in
place, provide places to attach lines away from the dock, or provide
fence-like structures for prohibiting crossing areas and partial
protection from waves and wind.

Regular navigation rules apply within a marina. This includes passing
vessels on opposing tacks to starboard (your port sides face each
other; "drive on the right side of the road") and giving way to
unpowered vessels such as canoes. Marinas can also impose their own
navigation rules. An overtaking vessel has to give way, and passing
from behind within a marina is never done. In general, it is tight
quarters and taking all care to avoid collisions and compromising
another boat's maneuverability is the norm.

Docking positions within a marina are reserved. Unless pulling into
your own slip, it is necessary to make arrangements with the marina
and dock in the location and facing direction specified. There is
usually a nightly cost for visiting yachts, although some marinas have
reciprocal relationships for members of with other nearby marinas.

Some marinas have temporary "dinghy docks" for temporarily landing
tenders; *fuel docks* for fuel, water, and emptying holding tanks;
*customs docks* for clearing a national border; restaurant docks; and
passenger/provision loading and unloading docks. Those do not always
require reservations, but it is best to assume that they do and call
the marina on a phone or VHF before mooring to them. Always leave
those docks as soon as possible to make room for others.

Public boat launches and docks are always for temporary use. They are
controlled by the local harbor master or self-service if the area
has no master.


Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The considerations based on the location when docking and undocking
are:

- Direction of approach/exit, and room to maneuver
  - Side docking
  - Slip with another boat
  - Private slip
- Mooring side to the dock
  - Stern to
  - Bow to
  - Port to
  - Starbord to
- Water current relative to approach and side
- Wind relative to approach and side

There are considerations based on the type of boat. A boat will handle
differently and present options based on its windage, drive type,
propeller characteristics, the presence of thrusters, and whether it
is has single or dual rudders.

Docking while shorthanded or singlehanded can require special
techniques. All keelboat docking under power requires careful
planning. The crew must be briefed on the plan, the lines and fenders
prepared, and the skipper have multiple backup plans if something
fails.

Above 35 feet the mass and windage of the boat is such that it is no
longer an option to use human brute force to start or stop boat motion
or hold the boat off the dock and other vessels. Careful manipulation
of forces is required. 

The engine/propeller is only one force available. Large boat docking
maneuvers involve active use of fenders and lines to pull and press on
the boat. These are not just for protection and fastening to the dock.


Maneuvering Under Power
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats with rudders require some forward or
backward motion relative to the water to have steerage. Generally, one
uses only enough power to have steerage and maintain way against the
current and wind _and no more_ when maneuvering within a marina. For
example, keeping speed low enough to produce no wake and be able to
stop quickly (less than 5 kts) when in main fairway and extremely slow
(1-2 kts) when in a secondary fairway and actually docking.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. On a
single lever, it should be moved into neutral, and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.
  
A boat with strong prop walk is able to back and fill 


Docklines
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good docklines are slightly stretchy, to absorb some energy from shock loads
instead of transmitting it to the cleats. This is in contrast to halyards,
which have minimal stretch.

Docklines should be UV-resistant, large enough to easily handle.

The ropes attaching a boat to a dock and pilings have slightly
different naming conventions depending on how they attach to
shore. Technically, these lines are all properly called by the more
specific term "warps".  However, I've never heard anyone in a marina
refer to something such as a "starboard after spring warp" outside 
of reading about full size ships.

Spring Lines
: Diagonals overlapping the scope of the boat. That is, they lead
  forward from the middle or stern or aft from the bow or middle.
  These prevent forward and backward movement of the boat.
  These are named:

  {side: *starboard* or *port*} + 
  <br>{direction to the dock cleat: *forward* or *aft*} + 
  <br>{boat cleat: *bow*, *midship*, or *stern*} + 
  <br>*spring line*.
  
  It is common to only say the direction and "spring" and skip the
  boat cleat if it is "bow" or "stern" and only moored on one
  side. For example, on a boat docked port-to, the line from the
  boat's stern cleat running forward might be referred to casually as
  "_the_ forward spring", with the fact that it is on port and from
  the stern boat cleat implied. Some people use the word "back"
  for both "aft" directions and "stern" positions.

Brest Lines
: Short lines perpendicular to the boat. These prevent movement
  away from the dock. They are named:

  {side: *starboard* or *port*} +
  <br>{boat cleat: *bow*, *midship*, or *stern*} +
  <br>*brest line*.
  
  Note that this is the same formula as the spring line naming, except
  that the direction to the dock is not needed because it is always
  perpendicular instead of forward or aft.

Bow Line
: Leads forward from the bow, usually at a 45 degree angle. Prevents
  movement backward and away from the dock.  It is also common
  practice to call a bow brest line "the bow line" if there is no
  proper bow line.

Stern Line
: Leads aft from the stern, usually at a 45 degree angle. Prevents
  movement forward and away from the dock. It is also common practice
  to call a stern brest line "the stern line" if there is no proper
  stern line.

The term *after* may be substituted for *aft* as a direction.

Very long boats may have additional cleats named *forward quarter* 
(between bow and midship) and *aft quarter* (between midship and stern).

These lines may be used both when moored to the dock and also rigged
in different configurations to control power and point the boat when
maneuvering off the dock to leave.

Solo Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All single-handed mooring on a keelboat is tricky. It requires
maneuvering as slowly and carefully as possible, planning well ahead,
and adapting techniques to your specific vessel, abilities, and
location. 

My own default method for docking single-handed is as follows, for
both side docking and docking in a slip. I rig a single line from the
midship cleat to the stern cleat on the side that will be docked.
This acts as a temporary combined forward stern spring line and stern
brest line, and needs to have enough slack for that role. I cleat it
at both ends, so that I'm not resisting any force with my body when
docking. If there's an eye splice in the dock line, I put that splice
around or through the midship cleat so that the stern end is available
to be uncleated quickly if needed.

I approach the dock as slowly as possible, given the constraints of
wind and current. If the desired docking orientation is such that the
prop walk in reverse will pull the stern in to the dock (which is
beneficial!) and I'm approaching in forward gear, then I come in at a
slight angle with the bow tilted towards the dock. Otherwise, I try to
be as parallel as possible to the dock. I briefly reverse hard to
remove most forward motion and drop that forward spring line over a
dock cleat from the stern. When using prop walk, the stern will nicely
tuck in at the last moment. I then _gently_ accelerate forward against
the line that I just dropped.

As long as there is forward thrust, the temporary aft spring/stern
brest line will keep the boat pressed to the dock. There is no hurry
at this point. The boat isn't going anywhere any more. I then step off
the boat with the engine still engaged in forward and attach other
lines, starting with the bow. Once the boat is held at bow and stern I
shut off the engine and rig the permanent dock lines.

If reversing into the dock, I follow the same procedure but am always
as parallel as possible to the dock because forward prop walk is
generally light. I of course move briefly hard into forward instead to
stop motion, and then reduce throttle to maintain minimal forward
thrust and hold the boat against the temporary spring line.

Since the spring line is attached at two points, if I miss the first
cast, I can quickly hauled it back onto the boat for a second cast.
It is important to have a fallback plan if the wind and current are
pushing the boat away from the dock in case there is not enough time
for a second cast (or, truly exceptionally: if the line or a cleat
break). This is especially true in a slip shared with another boat.
Having fenders on the far side of the boat is a good safeguard.

I note that another possible fallback strategy when using a slip to
prefer to reverse in, stern first. Then, if something goes wrong it is
relatively easy to pull out forward and try again. In contrast, when
pulling forward into a slip it is hard to back out in an
emergency. The lack of initial steerage and potential prop walk in
reverse means that the boat may turn or drift sideways significantly
before steerage is established. The other advantage of backing in is
that the helm is close to both the main dock and finger as it enters
the slip, and thus easier to judge distance.

When leaving a dock singlehanded, I rig a slip line. This must be
twice the length of a typical spring line in order to reach the dock
and come back to the helm. I set it up as the last line to be
released.  The slip line is hitched or looped over a cleat on the
boat, runs around but is not hitched to dock cleat, and then runs back
to the helm to be held in hand. Ideally the line passes through an
open fairlead in the toe rail so that it is not pulling directly
against my arm, although then it is vulnerable to snagging at a kink
in the line when cast off.

There is always a tense moment of trying to retrieve the part of that
line when it necessarily falls in the water, which unfortunately also
must happen at the exact moment that I need to turn the helm and
increase power to pull away. There's no way to avoid this risk, but
attention and speed can minimize it. Any good sailor is paranoid about
lines in the water snagging the prop or under a dock.

When leaving a sidedocked berth singlehanded the springing off method
should be used. It must be modified to suit a solo sailor. The
standard recommended method is to use a single slip line for the
spring.

### Alone in a Crowd

Despite its unique challenges, solo docking has the advantage that the
crew never do anything unexpected at a critical time, since there is
no crew!

For that reason, I often choose to dock using single-handed methods
when only guests or novice crew are available on board. However, I take
advantage of my crew by briefing them before we enter the marina on
the backup plan. For example: 

> _Move this roving fender to keep it between our hull and that boat or piling,
> while keeping your body inside the lifelines_,

or

> _If I say `Plan B!,' then hop off onto the dock at the shrouds,
> loop this line under the dock cleat, and hold it tight._

It is also very important when working with novice crew to
explicitly tell them _not_ to leave the boat or fend off anything
without permission. Someone eager to help could leap off the boat or
push the boat away from a piling--into something else on the other side--at
absolutely the worst moment. That creates a new hazard when the skipper is
least able to handle it.

Likewise, I'm cautious of accepting help from someone I don't know on
shore when docking (or leaving). A sailing buddy or marina dockhand
appearing when docking solo is a wonderful sight. A kind stranger who
may know nothing about boats or sailboats can be a disaster. They
might drop a line in the water, hitch a line incorrectly and jam
it, or most commonly, pull the bow into the dock and thus
inadvertently force the stern off.


Side Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Side docking for boats yields a similar result to parallel parking for
cars. The port or starbord side of the boat is attached to a dock or
wall, with no other structure to tie to immediately in front or
behind. There are usually other boats in front and behind, although
there may be pilings, a wall, or the end of the dock instead.


### Springing Off 

For a dinghy, 20' keelboat, or even 30' boat in light wind with a full
crew, it is common to use brute force to get the boat off the dock in
the presence of unfavorable wind and current. One can simply shove the
bow off and quickly motor or trim in sails to clear adjacent
obstructions.

Brute force doesn't work in higher wind and for larger boats. A laden
40' cruiser in 4 kts of current and 20 kts of wind simply can't be
shoved around.  Mechanical leverage from lines and protection by
fenders instead of arms is necessary in those cases to be effective
and safe.

I've previously described a solo method of using a slip spring line
for springing off singlehanded. I've never had to side-dock or undock
a large keelboat solo, and so have I've only used that myself when
practicing in ideal conditions. It worked well in those cases but I
can't speak to adverse conditions; I'd do everything possible to avoid
having to leave a dock solo in adverse conditions, including simply
trying to wait it out and with asking for help if waiting was not
possible. 

Two alternatives to springing off singlehanded that I have no personal
experience with are:

- ["Spronging"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bLf7C-jAG0) using a slip line from the _far_ side of the boat from the dock.
- [Pulling on the stern](https://youtu.be/4aPwZ6g_-ww?t=790) directly from the dock to avoid using lines. 


## Warping

When facing significantly adverse conditions or maneuvering the boat
_without_ an engine in a marina, use the traditional technique of
*warping*. This simply means connecting the boat to pilings or cleats
on other docks by carying them there in a tender or lassoing them, 
and then moving the boat by easing and tightening multiple lines.

Obviously, warping requires patience, sufficient crew, and a
fairway that is free of other traffic. It has the advantage of being
extremely safe as the boat is under static control at all times
and relatively invulnerable to wind and current.

When working on docks during the season or closing up a marina at the
end of the year, I've personally used warping extensively on small
(19') keelboats and dinghies. I've never had to do so with larger
keelboats. If I had to move a large boat to another berth inside a
marina with an engine failure or growing gale conditions, then I would 
use warping instead of attempting to tow from a motor launch.

Slip Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a slip, the boat is driven into a slot and effectively side docked
to a finger dock, and either bow-in or stern-in to the main dock. A
private slip has fingers on both sides and is ideal, but rarely
available. There is usually another boat on the side opposite the
finger, and there may be a piling between them at the outlet.

A slip is generally preferred to side docking because it is more
protected from waves and wind, and there is less risk of hitting (or
being hit by) another boat. It also provides access to both one end
and the full side of the boat for maintenance and is usually subject
to less foot and cart traffic, since only one other crew is likely to
use the finger.

Catamarans are often ineligible for slips because their beam consumes
two monohulls' worth of docking space, and would require a perfectly
sized slip. Similarly, very long boats (over 60 feet) are seldom
stored in slips because the slip would have to be extremely long.

The correct
[US inland sound signal](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/navRules/navrules.pdf)
is one long horn blast when leaving your berth under power. This also
applies when approaching an area marina with restricted visibility
under any form of propulsion, such as rounding the edge of a
breakwater or sea wall. If you are reversing under propulsion,
following the "leaving berth" long blast with three short blasts is
also required. So, a bow-in docked vessel leaving a marina would
typically give one long blast an three short blasts when starting, and
then a separate long blast when later rounding the breakwater.

However, local practice on the use of sound signal in a marina
[varies](https://www.trawlerforum.com/forums/s4/do-you-use-prologned-signal-exiting-berth-marina-5760.html).
For example, marinas with mostly mid-sized (less than 50 feet) boats
and lots of live aboard sailors or nearby houses often discourage
making sound signals. The constant blasting of horns would disrupts
those living and sleeping nearby. I've _never_ heard any sound signals
in a mooring field or anchorage, for the same reason. Dinghies and
paddled vessels almost never signal, as they don't have horns on board
or free hands to operate them. 

At the other extreme, a cruise or cargo ship will always make a very
long and very loud horn blast before getting underway...although this
signal is likely too late for you to comfortably get clear of the ship
at that point if you weren't already monitoring VHF and staying well
clear.
