                         **Mooring and Anchoring**
                            Updated 2023-01-03

*Mooring* is attaching a boat to a permanent structure, such as a dock, piling,
or anchored mooring. The skills involved are maneuvering the boat to come to a 
stop at the right point, attaching it securely, and detaching and leaving
the mooring safely.

*Anchoring* is temporarily attaching a boat to the ground. The skills involved
are selecting a location, securing the anchor to the bottom and preparing
sufficient scope, and freeing and retrieving the anchor.

The two are sometimes combined, such as when *Mediterranean mooring* with a
bow anchor and stern to a dock, or *tying to shore* by combining an anchor
with one or more lines to rocks and trees.

<i>Improper mooring and anchoring endanger your boat, other vessels, and
the crews on them. As with all of the notes in this series, I'm
collecting publicly available information here and adding some of my
personal experience, but not vouching for the accuracy or
applicability of any of this information for your own sailing. Confirm
everything with other sources, local experts, and your own
experimentation. Be aware of your environment and conditions and adapt
your techniques appropriately.

My personal experience in mooring and anchoring large boats is
limited. I've docked, anchored, and picked up moorings thousands of
times on small sail and powerboats. I've only performed those
operations as skipper about 40 times in my life on keelboats over
20'.</i>


Docking
======================================================================

Boats with balasted keels are usually anchored or moored between
sailing sessions. However, it is possible to *trailer sail* small
keelboats and pull them out with a towed trailer at a ramp each time.

Keelboats _can_ be moored and anchored under sail, or sculling or
rowing, and traditionally were in many situations. However, today's
marinas and anchorages are crowded and the boats are wider (beamier)
than they were used to be. So it is now common and considered
courtious to moor under power whenever possible to reduce the room
consumed by the maneuver and the risk to one's neighbors. In most
marinas, only purpose-built racing boats and the smallest of keelboats
will typically leave their berth under sail alone.

Keelboat docking needs to be approached with care and respect for the
risks. As with an airplane, the most difficult and dangerous parts of
operating a keelboat are when it is close to land and
obstructions. Outside of extreme weather, the actual sailing part is
relatively easy because there's more time to react to changing
situations and nothing to hit.

Crew and the skipper need to be extra careful and vigilant to avoid
the boat striking objects or any part of their bodies being caught
between the boat and another object.

Falling overboard when docking or undocking is even more dangerous
than while sailing. There is a high risk of hitting a dock when
falling, striking a hard or sharp an underwater hazard, or becoming
trapped against a wall or vessel. (Marina water is also not
particularly clean and can have electrical currents propagating
through it, so is both dangerous and gross to find oneself swimming
in.)

It is important to not hit other boats with the tender or catch its
tow line and bridle in the mothership's propeller. So, boats with a
tender ensure that it is lifted out of the water, affixed firmly
alongside the mothership, or on a short painter while docking and
anchoring.


Parts of a Marina
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A marina typically has a *breakwater* outer wall that protects it from
wind and waves, a wide main *fairway* (water road), narrower side fairways,
and *slips* in which one or two boats are stored off those side fairways.

*Fixed* docks maintain a constant elevation relative to the ground and
are either high or in non-tidal areas. *Floating* docks move vertically
with the water level, and may provide less steady footing. *Fingers* are
very narrow docks between sets of boats and can be extremely unsteady 
footing. 

*Pilings* are strong poles driven into the ground. They may support
fixed docks from beneath, the sides of floating docks to keep them in
place, provide places to attach lines away from the dock, or provide
fence-like structures for prohibiting crossing areas and partial
protection from waves and wind.

Regular navigation rules apply within a marina. This includes passing
vessels port side to port side ("drive on the right side of the road")
and giving way to unpowered vessels such as canoes. Marinas can also
impose their own navigation rules. An overtaking vessel has to give
way, and passing from behind within a marina is never done. In
general, it is tight quarters and taking all care to avoid collisions
and compromising another boat's maneuverability is the norm.

Docking positions within a marina are reserved. Unless pulling into
your own slip, it is necessary to make arrangements with the marina
and dock in the location and facing direction specified. There is
usually a nightly cost for visiting yachts, although some marinas have
reciprocal relationships for members of with other nearby marinas.

Some marinas have temporary docks: "dinghy docks" for landing tenders;
*fuel docks* for fuel, water, and pumpout; *customs docks* for
clearing a national border; restaurant docks; and passenger/provision
loading and unloading docks. Those do not always require reservations,
but it is best to assume that they do and call the marina on a phone
or VHF before mooring to them. Always leave those docks as soon as
possible to make room for others.

Public boat launches and docks are always for temporary use. They are
controlled by the local harbor master or self-service if the area
has no master.


Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The considerations based on the location when docking and undocking
are:

- Direction of approach/exit, and room to maneuver
  - Side docking
  - Slip with another boat
  - Private slip
- Mooring side to the dock
  - Stern to
  - Bow to
  - Port to
  - Starbord to
- Water current relative to approach and side
- Wind relative to approach and side

There are considerations based on the type of boat. A boat will handle
differently and present options based on its windage, drive type,
propeller characteristics, the presence of thrusters, and whether it
is has single or dual rudders.

Docking while shorthanded or singlehanded can require special
techniques. All keelboat docking under power requires careful
planning. The crew must be briefed on the plan, the lines and fenders
prepared, and the skipper have multiple backup plans if something
fails.

On a small boat, it is common to simply shove off a dock, hold the 
lifelines from the dock, or fend off another boat when needed in close
quarters. 

On large boats, the mass and windage of the make it impractical to use
human brute force to start or stop boat motion or hold the boat off
the dock and other vessels. What works for 19 foot, one ton keelboat
could be impossible on a 50 foot, 25 ton yacht. Careful manipulation
of mechanical forces is required.

The engine/propeller is only one force available. Large boat docking
maneuvers involve active use of fenders and lines to pull and press on
the boat. These are not just for protection and fastening to the dock.


Maneuvering Under Power
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats require water passing over the rudder to to
steer. Generally, one uses only enough power to have steerage and
maintain way against the current and wind _and no more_ when
maneuvering within a marina. For example, keeping speed low enough to
produce no wake and be able to stop quickly (less than 5 kts) when in
main fairway and extremely slow (1-2 kts) when in a secondary fairway
and actually docking.

The larger and heavier the boat, the longer it will take to respond
to direction changes between forward and reverse. While waiting
for the propeller to change the forward-aft movement, wind and current
continue to act on the boat. 

When in reverse, or forward in a boat with dual rudders, the rudder
acts in the direction that the boat is _actually_ going (its
velocity), not the direction that the thrust (acceleration) is
directed/way you _want_ to go.  So, if the boat is moving forward and
the helmsperson shifts into reverse, they must continue steering for
the foward direction until the motion stops and boat actually starts
moving in reverse. 

However, on a boat with a single rudder, even immediately after
shifting into forward there is prop wash over on the rudder which can
be directed as a sort of stern thruster.  This means that while
drifting backwards, the helmsperson can shift into forward with high
throttle to force the stern to slide laterally as if they were moving
forward, even though the boat is still moving backwards.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. A
single single lever system must be shifted into and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.

Fore and aft speed over ground stretches the radius when
turning. Reducing speed by shifting into neutral or reversing
direction to slow the boat as it turns will tighten the turning
radius. Likewise, turning while moving upwind is sharper than while
moving downwind. Of course, some way is required to maintain steerage.
So, if fore and after speed is eliminated to make the sharpest turn,
there is temporarily no steering control. 

It is possible to turn a boat nearly in its own length, which is
necessary when turning around within a narrow fairway. To do this, the
helm must exploit momentum and change directions while turning.  They
pull to the leeward side of the fairway, shift into neutral, and turn
the rudder hard to windward. As the boat turns, it will also get
closer to the windward boats. The helm then reverses thrust briefly,
while keeping the rudder over until the boat begins to move backwards.
At that point the helm throws the rudder the other way. The process
then repeats when the boat gets closer to the leeward side, although
more conservatively there, and continues alternating thrust and rudder
orientation while always maintaining the turn's momentum in the same
direction.

This is called a *three point turn*. In light wind it can be executed
without ever making way in reverse (although the thrust must still be
reversed to stop forward motion temporarily and tighten the turn).  In
heavy wind or a very narrow fairway, it may take many more than three
points to turn.

If the boat has prop walk, prefer to turn in the direction where prop
walk assists the turn. This is turning clockwise, to starboard for a
boat that walks to port in reverse. The turning maneuver is then
called a *back and fill* and can be exceptionally tight.


It is common on recent 35' and larger performance cruisers to have
twin rudders and a sail drive. This configuration is efficient for
motoring forwards long distances and sailing, but can be challenging
to maneuver in tight quarters. It has no prop wash, minimal prop walk,
and often the boat requires significant movement in reverse before
there is any steerage available. 

In my limited personal experience with this configuration, I've found
two strategies the best for moving in reverse. The first is to
initiate turns while moving forward. I use a brief reverse thrust
without changing the helm to halt the forward velocity while
maintaining the turn in place. If the rotation ends earlier than
needed, I give forward thrust without touching the helm. This is like
a back and fill, but does not gain the advantage of prop walk.

The second strategy is to turn the boat around long before reverse is
needed, and back into the side fairway or dock from that long distance.
This requires steering in reverse for longer, but ensures that the
boat has steerage when the critical backing occurs because it was
already in motion.



Docklines
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Material

Good docklines are slightly stretchy, to absorb some energy from shock loads
instead of transmitting it to the cleats. This is in contrast to halyards,
which should have minimal stretch. 

Docklines should be UV-resistant because they are perpetually exposed
to sun. The must be thick enough to easily handle, resist chafe, and
grip cleats. Docklines must also be thin enough to retain their shock
resistance and run smoothly around cleats.

Nylon is popular for dock lines. It stretches 15% of its length at 20%
of breaking strength. Nylon is resistant to UV, salt water, and fuel
and many other common chemicals around boats. Nylon lines also float,
making them less likely to snag a prop or underwater obstruction.
Polyester has recently overtaken nylon as a dock line material, and 
some manufacturers recommend it over nylon. 

Braided lines are stronger, nicer to handle, and more attractive.
Doubly so for double-braided.  Three-strand lines are stretchier, so
less likely to break under shock loads. They are also less expensive
and easier to splice and work in freezing temperatures.


![Mooring compensator](mooring-compensator.jpg width=256) A rubber mooring compensator (sometimes also called a rubber mooring
snubber) creates extra stretch and shock resistance in a line by
turning it into a spring.

Dock lines should have eye splices instead of tied loops in
them. Splices preserve most of the strength of the line while knots
weaken the line substantially.

### Naming

![](line-names.svg width=100%)

The ropes attaching a boat to a dock and pilings have slightly
different naming conventions depending on how they attach to
shore. Technically, these lines are all properly called by the more
specific term "warps".  However, I've never heard anyone in a marina
refer to something such as a "starboard after spring warp" outside 
of reading about full size ships.

Spring Lines
: Diagonals overlapping the scope of the boat. That is, they lead
  forward from the middle or stern or aft from the bow or middle.
  These prevent forward and backward movement of the boat.
  These are named:

  {side: *starboard* or *port*} + 
  <br>{direction to the dock cleat: *forward* or *aft*} + 
  <br>{boat cleat: *bow*, *midship*, or *stern*} + 
  <br>*spring line*.
  
  It is common to only say the direction and "spring" and skip the
  boat cleat if it is "bow" or "stern" and only moored on one
  side. For example, on a boat docked port-to, the line from the
  boat's stern cleat running forward might be referred to casually as
  "_the_ forward spring", with the fact that it is on port and from
  the stern boat cleat implied. "After" may be used instead of "aft".
  Some people use the word "back" for both "aft" directions and
  "stern" positions.

Brest Lines
: Short lines perpendicular to the boat. These prevent movement
  away from the dock. They are named:

  {side: *starboard* or *port*} +
  <br>{boat cleat: *bow*, *midship*, or *stern*} +
  <br>*brest line*.
  
  Note that this is the same formula as the spring line naming, except
  that the direction to the dock is not needed because it is always
  perpendicular instead of forward or aft.

Bow Line
: Leads forward from the bow, usually at a 45 degree angle. Prevents
  movement backward and away from the dock.  It is also common
  practice to call a bow brest line "the bow line" if there is no
  proper bow line.

Stern Line
: Leads aft from the stern, usually at a 45 degree angle. Prevents
  movement forward and away from the dock. It is also common practice
  to call a stern brest line "the stern line" if there is no proper
  stern line.

The term *after* may be substituted for *aft* as a direction.

Very long boats may have additional cleats named *forward quarter* 
(between bow and midship) and *aft quarter* (between midship and stern).

These lines may be used both when moored to the dock and also rigged
in different configurations to control power and point the boat when
maneuvering off the dock to leave.

Fenders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fenders keep the boat from smashing into obstructions and damaging
the hull or the other object. In the event of a light collision they
play a role similar to bumpers on a car. However, unlike car bumpers
there are many situations in which the fender is expected to be 
compressed as part of a maneuver or docking position. 

As buoyant objects stored close at hand in a lazarette, fenders are
useful in an emergency for throwing to crew overboard. In practice,
ball fenders are frequently repurposed as racing marks, ad-hoc or
private buoys, or private mooring balls. They can also be used to
float an anchor or sea-anchor line, or as an anchor float (described
below).

- Should hang just above the water
- Tie on to the toe rail or lifeline/rail with clove hitch or RT2HH, often
  as a slip knot
- Ball vs. cylinder
- Horizontal vs. vertical
- Covers
- Fender boards


Attaching to the Dock
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](side-alternatives.svg width=100%)


Solo Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All single-handed mooring on a keelboat is tricky. It requires
maneuvering as slowly and carefully as possible, planning well ahead,
and adapting techniques to your specific vessel, abilities, and
location. 

My own default method for docking single-handed is as follows, for
both side docking and docking in a slip. I rig a single line from the
midship cleat to the stern cleat on the side that will be docked.
This acts as a temporary combined forward stern spring line and stern
brest line, and needs to have enough slack for that role. I cleat it
at both ends, so that I'm not resisting any force with my body when
docking. If there's an eye splice in the dock line, I put that splice
around or through the midship cleat so that the stern end is available
to be uncleated quickly if needed.

I approach the dock as slowly as possible, given the constraints of
wind and current. If the desired docking orientation is such that the
prop walk in reverse will pull the stern in to the dock (which is
beneficial!) and I'm approaching in forward gear, then I come in at a
slight angle with the bow tilted towards the dock. Otherwise, I try to
be as parallel as possible to the dock. I briefly reverse hard to
remove most forward motion and drop that forward spring line over a
dock cleat from the stern. When using prop walk, the stern will nicely
tuck in at the last moment. I then _gently_ accelerate forward against
the line that I just dropped and turn the rudder as if steering away
from the dock.

As long as there is forward thrust, the temporary aft spring/stern
brest line will keep the boat pressed to the dock. There is no hurry
at this point. The boat isn't going anywhere any more. I then step off
the boat with the engine still engaged in forward and attach other
lines, starting with the bow. Once the boat is held at bow and stern I
shut off the engine and rig the permanent dock lines.

If reversing into the dock, I follow the same procedure with the
thrust reversed, but unless there is strong wind or current, am always
as parallel as possible to the dock because forward prop walk is
generally light.

Since the spring line is attached at two points, if I miss the first
cast, I can quickly hauled it back onto the boat for a second cast.
It is important to have a fallback plan if the wind and current are
pushing the boat away from the dock in case there is not enough time
for a second cast (or, truly exceptionally: if the line or a cleat
breaks). This is especially true in a slip shared with another boat.
Having fenders on the far side of the boat is a good safeguard.

When using a slip I prefer to back in, stern first. This puts me
closest to the dock to judge distance and if something goes wrong it
is relatively easy to pull out forward and try again.

In contrast, when pulling forward into a slip it is harder to quickly
back out in an emergency. The lack of initial steerage and potential
prop walk in reverse means that the boat may turn or drift sideways
significantly before steerage is established. The other advantage of
backing in is that the helm is close to both the main dock and finger
as it enters the slip, and thus easier to judge distance.

When leaving a dock singlehanded, I rig a slip line. This must be
twice the length of a typical spring line in order to reach the dock
and come back to the helm. I set it up as the last line to be
released.  The slip line is hitched or looped over a cleat on the
boat, runs around but is not hitched to dock cleat, and then runs back
to the helm to be held in hand. Ideally the line passes through an
open fairlead in the toe rail so that it is not pulling directly
against my arm, although then it is vulnerable to snagging at a kink
in the line when cast off.

There is always a tense moment of trying to retrieve the part of that
line when it necessarily falls in the water, which unfortunately also
must happen at the exact moment that I need to turn the helm and
increase power to pull away. There's no way to avoid this risk, but
attention and speed can minimize it. Any good sailor is paranoid about
lines in the water snagging the prop or under a dock.

When springing off a sidedocked berth solo, a single slip line for the
spring line is the only practical way to handle the lines.


![](single-docking.svg)

0. Hang fenders on both sides and rig an aft midship spring line, keeping
   the working end of the line near the stern.

1. Reverse down the final fairway. If it is wide enough, hug the side
   opposite the berth. Begin the turn in reverse.
   
2. If the fairway is not wide enough, perform the turn in place
   by applying brief forward thrust to stop backwards linear motion
   while maintaining the momentum of the turn. Do not change
   the helm during this turn.
   
3. When nearly straight, resume backing into the berth.

4. Use forward thrust to bring the boat to a stop with the skipper
   right next to a dock cleat at the stern.
   
5. Throw the spring line around the stern dock cleat, pull the slack
   out of the line, and cleat it off to the stern boat cleat.
   
6. Apply light forward thrust, which will pin the boat to the dock against
   the spring line.
   
7. Step off the boat and attach the bow and stern lines, and then shift
   out of gear.



### Alone with Company

Despite its unique challenges, solo docking has the advantage that the
crew never do anything unexpected at a critical time, since there is
no crew!

For that reason, I often choose to dock using single-handed methods
when only guests or novice crew are available on board. However, I take
advantage of my crew by briefing them before we enter the marina on
the backup plan. For example: 

> _Move this roving fender to keep it between our hull and that boat or piling,
> while keeping your body inside the lifelines_,

or

> _If I say `Plan B!,' then hop off onto the dock at the shrouds,
> loop this line under the dock cleat, and hold it tight._

It is also very important when working with novice crew to explicitly
tell them _not_ to leave the boat or fend off anything without
permission. Someone eager to help could leap off the boat or push the
boat away from a piling--into something else on the other side--at
absolutely the worst moment. That creates a new hazard when the
skipper is least able to handle it.

Likewise, I'm cautious of accepting help from someone I don't know on
shore when docking (or leaving). A sailing buddy or marina dockhand
appearing when docking solo is a wonderful sight. A kind stranger who
may know nothing about boats or sailboats can be a disaster. They
might drop a line in the water, hitch a line incorrectly and jam
it, or most commonly, pull the bow into the dock and thus
inadvertently force the stern off.


Side Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Side docking for boats yields a similar result to parallel parking for
cars. The port or starbord side of the boat is attached to a dock or
wall, with no other structure to tie to immediately in front or
behind. There are usually other boats in front and behind, although
there may be pilings, a wall, or the end of the dock instead.

### Head In

The helm selects a cleat on the dock that will become the midship
point. They approach the dock at a 45 degree angle headed directly for
that cleat, with 2-3 kts of boat speed. 

When the bow is about 1.5 meters from the cleat, they turn the boat
hard parallel to the dock and simultaneously reverse hard to stop
forward movement. This causes the boat to "skid out" like a drifting
rally car. It will contact the dock at the desired cleat at midship
with nearly zero remaining velocity.

The crew then quickly step onto the dock and rig a midship brest line
to prevent the boat from moving in any direction. (The US Sailing guide
skips this step.)

They then rig a spring line and push against it with the engine until
the boat can be permanently moored:

* If the wind is off the dock or from astern, this is an aft midship
  spring line (from the midship boat cleat running back to a dock
  cleat near the stern), and the helm steers the rudder hard away from
  the dock and in low forward thrust.

* If the wind is into the dock or from ahead, this is a forward
  midship spring line (from the midship boat cleat running forward to
  a dock cleat near the bow), and the helm uses low reverse
  thrust. The rudder position does not matter because there is no prop
  wash over it in reverse.

If the
[wind or current are very strong](https://sailing-blog.nauticed.org/how-to-dock-a-sailboat-in-heavy-wind/)
pushing the boat away from the dock, the skipper
initially approaches at steeper angle (more perpendicular) and with a little
more speed. 

If the wind or current are pushing the boat into the dock, then less
speed and a shallower angle (more parallel to the dock) can be used,
turning well off the dock and letting the boat drift in sideways.

Downwind side docking may require more space on the dock within which
to stop.

### Stern In


### Springing Off 

For a dinghy, 20' keelboat, or even 30' boat in light wind with a full
crew, it is common to use brute force to get the boat off the dock in
the presence of unfavorable wind and current. One can simply shove the
bow off and quickly motor or trim in sails to clear adjacent
obstructions.

Brute force doesn't work in higher wind and for larger boats. A laden
40' cruiser in 4 kts of current and 20 kts of wind simply can't be
shoved around.  Mechanical leverage from lines and protection by
fenders instead of arms is necessary in those cases to be effective
and safe. 

Springing off is a safe and controlled way to bring the bow or stern
away from a side docked berth to pull into the fairway clear of
obstructions. The process is simple. When the boat is held to the dock
by a single midship spring line, opposing that line with engine thrust
will turn the boat.

![Example of springing off the bow using a forward stern spring line.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWyQp6veMFs)

*To bring the bow out*, rig a forward stern spring line. That is, from
the stern forward to a dock cleat that is near midship. Put a ball
fender between the stern and the dock. Reverse slowly and steadily.
The boat will squeeze the fender and the bow will slowly rotate out,
to a limit of about 45 degrees.

*To bring the stern out*, rig an aft bow spring line. That is,
from a bow cleat back to a dock cleat that is near midship.
Put a ball fender between the bow and the dock. Thrust forward
slowly and steadily. The boat will sequeeze the fender and stern
will slowly rotate out, to a limit of about 45 degrees.

In each case, rig the spring as a slip line. It should be hitched
to or looped over a cleat on the boat, run through a fairlead
in the toe rail, run around (but not hitched to) a dock cleat,
and then run back to the same point on the boat with a crew member
holding it. Have the crew member loop it around a cleat or hold
against the fairlead so that they are not taking the force of the 
line directly. 

If there are two crew available in addition to the skipper at the
helm, have a second crew member hold a slip brest line at the end
of the boat that is being sprung off. That line should not be under
tension. It is present only so that if something goes wrong the boat
can be brought back to the initial position and re-docked.

When the boat is at the desired orientation off the dock, slip and
quickly recover any dock lines and head out.

I've previously described a solo method of using a slip spring line
for springing off singlehanded. I've never had to side-dock or undock
a large keelboat solo, and so have I've only used that myself when
practicing in ideal conditions. It worked well in those cases but I
can't speak to adverse conditions; I'd do everything possible to avoid
having to leave a dock solo in adverse conditions, including simply
trying to wait it out and with asking for help if waiting was not
possible. 

Two alternatives to springing off singlehanded that I have no personal
experience with are:

- ["Spronging"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bLf7C-jAG0) using a slip line from the _far_ side of the boat from the dock.
- [Pulling on the stern](https://youtu.be/4aPwZ6g_-ww?t=790) directly from the dock to avoid using lines. 


## Warping

When facing significantly adverse conditions or maneuvering the boat
_without_ an engine in a marina, use the traditional technique of
*warping*. This simply means moving the boat solely via lines to
pilings or other points on docks, other boats, or shore. It requires
at least two lines. One line maintains tension and control from the
point where the boat is leaving and one is where the boat is being
pulled towards.  Having more than two lines gives better control, and
it may be necessary to attach and detach many lines in sequence as the
boat moves through the marina.

To attach to warping lines, carry them along the dock, throw them to
people waiting, bring them across in a tender, or lasso the end point.

Obviously, warping requires patience, sufficient crew, and a fairway
that is free of other traffic. It has the advantage of being extremely
safe and intuitive compared to moving under power. The boat is under
static control at all times and relatively invulnerable to wind and
current. You are in control at all times, and so have the opportunity
to pause and reconsider your options if something goes wrong.

I've personally used warping extensively on small (19') keelboats and
dinghies. This was when working on docks during the season, bringing
out or putting away whole fleets. I've also used it when launching or
recovering small boats that are not rigged, especially at the 
end of the season when nobody wants to paddle to a boat ramp
in cold water against strong wind.

I've never personally warped a larger keelboat. If I had to move a
large boat to another berth inside a marina with an engine failure, or
in the face of growing gale conditions, then I would use warping
instead of attempting to tow from a motor launch or sail within a
marina.

Slip Docking
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a slip, the boat is driven into a slot and effectively side docked
to a finger dock, and either bow-in or stern-in to the main dock. A
private slip has fingers on both sides and is ideal, but rarely
available. There is usually another boat on the side opposite the
finger, and there may be a piling between them at the outlet.

A slip is generally preferred to side docking because it is more
protected from waves and wind, and there is less risk of hitting (or
being hit by) another boat. It also provides access to both one end
and the full side of the boat for maintenance and is usually subject
to less foot and cart traffic, since only one other crew is likely to
use the finger.

Catamarans are often ineligible for slips because their beam consumes
two monohulls' worth of docking space, and would require a perfectly
sized slip. Similarly, very long boats (over 60 feet) are seldom
stored in slips because the slip would have to be extremely long.

Navigation Signals
======================================================================

Navigation signals apply at all times, but are especially important
while docking and anchoring. That's when you're likely to be in close
proximity to other boats and have restricted visibility due to other
objects or the conditions that prompted you to stop sailing, such as
fog, rain, or darkness.

TODO: Powered in fog


The correct
[US inland sound signal](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/navRules/navrules.pdf)
is one long horn blast when leaving your berth under power. This also
applies when approaching an area marina with restricted visibility
under any form of propulsion, such as rounding the edge of a
breakwater or sea wall. If you are reversing under propulsion,
following the "leaving berth" long blast with three short blasts is
also required. So, a bow-in docked vessel leaving a marina would
typically give one long blast an three short blasts when starting, and
then a separate long blast when later rounding the breakwater.

However, local practice on the use of sound signal in a marina
[varies](https://www.trawlerforum.com/forums/s4/do-you-use-prologned-signal-exiting-berth-marina-5760.html).
For example, marinas with mostly mid-sized (less than 50 feet) boats
and lots of live aboard sailors or nearby houses often discourage
making sound signals. The constant blasting of horns would disrupt
those living and sleeping nearby. I've _never_ heard any sound signals
in a mooring field or anchorage, presumably for the same reason. I've
never heard any recreational boat give the reversing under power
signal. I've never heardany dinghy or paddled vessels signal at all
except in distress, which makese sense as they don't have horns on
board or free hands to operate them.

At the other extreme, a cruiseship will always make a very long and
very loud horn blast before getting underway...although this signal is
more about pagentry and is likely too late for you to comfortably get
clear if you weren't already monitoring VHF.

Fallback Plans
============================================================================

All aspects of sailing require multiple fallback plans and preparation
to enact them immediately in the event of an emergency or other change
of situation. A competent skipper is prepared to immediately take
action while sailing if the boat broaches, an obstruction is sighted,
or any equipment fails.

When docking or picking up a mooring, it is important to assume that 
one might miss the intended landing point or line cast and have a plan
for how to abort the operation and try again.

It is also necessary to prepare to react to unexpected situations that
are beyond the ability of the crew to prevent, as described
below. While sailing, many external problems such as weather or
obstructions can often be recognized some time in advance, and even
equipment failures are frequently slow moving problems that give some
time to consider and react. During docking and marina maneuvers,
problems can arise with little warning or time to respond.

## Escapes

When operating under power, the skipper must constantly be prepared to
handle an engine or propeller failure, grounding, an unexpected
obstruction, or the wind or current having unanticipated strength. The
"unexpected obstruction" could be a rock or submerged piling. But it
is often a power boat or kayak emerging from behind a dock or
breakwater. Lacking masts, those small boats are hard to spot early.

You have several resources available when operating under power. In
the more common case of needing to make an evasive maneuver when the
propulsion system is operating well, stopping, backing, or turning are
the main options. Consider which you'd use before the need arises
and keep an eye on that "escape" route to ensure it is clear.

## Propulsion Failures

Powered propulsion can fail as well. Some likely causes are running
out of fuel (due to an incorrect gauge or the idiocy of not checking),
the prop being fouled, a loose propeller not rotating with the shaft,
or an engine failure such as fuel or cooling system clog or broken
pump. Gaining control over the vessel takes priority over restarting
the engine in this situation. Attempting to diagnose and repair the
cause of the failure in time to recover control under power is usually
not realistic.

If a channel or sufficiently wide fairway with favorable wind and a
few minutes before anything disastrous happens, raising at least the
mainsail and proceeding under sail is my preference. This means that
the mainsail should always be ready to be raised when under power near
shore. The halyard must be attached to the head of the sail, the
working end to run and on the winch, and no significant lashings
holding down the sail.

In a tight anchorage or fairway with other traffic, raising the jib
before the mainsail allows the helmsperson to have some forward way
and steerage to avoid immediate collisions. The jib is usually faster
to raise or unfurl than the mainsail. Once the collision is avoided,
the crew can then raise the mainsail. Beware that when operating under
jib alone there is a lot of force blowing the bow off the wind.  This
prevents sailing in a close hauled direction or tacking.

If powered propulsion is lost outside of a marina with a bit of sea
room, then another option is temporarily dropping anchor. This will
slow or stop the drift of the boat to buy more time to recover control
or radio for assistance. Anchoring is especially valuable when faced
with a lee shore, where a hastily raised sail may not give enough power
to claw back to safety. 

Note that dropping anchor on short notice can be tricky. Someone has
to get to the bow (although hopefully there was already a lookout
there), if the engine failed then a powered windlass won't work, and
there's no time to set it well, so the anchor will likely drag and may
skip when dropped.

Responding to the unexpected requires creativity and judgement. In the
right conditions, it might be possible to leverage current or
prevailing wind, or surf a boat in waves to gain steerage in the event
of a loss of motor propulsion. The tender could be deployed to tow the
big boat. Crew could attempt to lasso pilings with docklines to warp
to safety. The boom can be weighted and swung out to heel the boat and
free it when grounded. But these methods are all risky and dangerous
in the wrong conditions, so the skipper's experience and awareness all
come into play for judging the tradeoffs.

## Sail Failures

A less common failure mode for anchoring or mooring is when the sails
cannot be dropped. Some causes of this are a halyard jamming at the
masthead or inside of the mast, a headsail twisting around another
forestay or instrument, an overridden halyard winch, a jammed halyard
cleat, a sail being caught on a spreader, a furler overriding and
jamming, the main jamming with a broken slide in the track, a battened
main catching on a lazy jack, and a furling main overriding and
jamming inside of the boom or mast.

Depending on the sea and wind conditions, being stuck with a sail up
can vary from annoyance to serious danger. The amount of time to
resolve it and choice of methods will be dictated by the sea
conditions. A jammed furling headsail can be dropped using the halyard
if it is possible to completely unfurl it. A halyard that is jammed at
the bottom can be dropped by cutting the halyard (although--then you have a
catastrophic problem when you need to raise the sail). Often a lightly
jammed furling main or broken slide can be cleared by raising and redropping
under appropriate tension.

In an extreme case, it may be necessary to cut a jammed sail, which is
expensive and dangerous as the free parts flies about in the wind. Or,
it might even be necessary to send crew up the mast. That is extremely
dangerous in wind and waves with a sail unfurled. There aren't great
options in some of these situations.  Rely on careful inspection,
preventative maintenance, and raising and lowering sails with care to
avoid the problem happening in the first place.

## Judging the Risk

What are the actual chances of needing to execute on a fallback plan
under power or docking? Having to back out of a fairway or dodge an
unexpected vessel is a fairly common occurence in my
experience. Motoring in a marina is like driving a car in busy parking
lot, where you know that others will be backing out and pedestrians
will be dashing between cars all of the time. In this analogy, paddleboarders
and kayakers are the dashing "pedestrians" of a marina.

A lightly jammed headsail that can be freed by pulling it back out and
refurling is also fairly common, especially on a charter boat where
you don't maintain the furler and may not be familiar with its
idiosyncrasies.

How often a furling main jams seems to depend highly on the furling
system and the skipper. Sailor bars and online sailing forums are full
of debate on this point. Claims vary from considering mainsail furling
to be a death trap to insisting that the main can reliably be furled
in a storm.

A tragically timed engine stall is something that doesn't shock me on
an older boat or a smaller one with an outboard, but isn't an everyday
problem. If it is an everyday problem, then you need engine
maintenance! (Or should forget the thing exists and plan to dock
without it.) A well-maintained inboard engine that has just been
inspected, has clean fuel, and is navigating through sufficiently
clean water is not the most likely failure point when motoring through
a marina.

I've had a few halyards jam on small rental keelboats after sailing in
strong wind. This happened from either from the sheave breaking at the
top or the halyard jamming in the cleat at the bottom. I think those
could have been prevented by better inspection and maintenance, as
well as sizing the cleats, blocks, and halyards appropriately. I've
fortunately never had a halyard jam on boats that I maintained, but
I've learned to carry a rigging knife when on someone else's
keelboat. I'd rather apologize and pay for cutting the halyard than
for sinking the boat.

With proper care in well-known waters, serious grounding is extremely
rare. However, even with careful attention to charts and tide tables,
with enough sailing time it probably a question of _when_, and not
_if_ a grounding will happen--and whether it is a slightly
embarrassing pause on a sandbar or a life threatening catastrophe with
waves pounding against a rocky shore. I don't know anyone with
significant sailing experience who hasn't grounded at some point. How
often grounding occurs depends on where and how you sail. My own
experiences have been largely with silted-in channels at low tide and
isolated submerged rocks in unfamiliar waters.
