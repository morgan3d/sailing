                         **Mooring and Anchoring**
                            Updated 2023-01-03

*Mooring* is attaching a boat to a permanent structure, such as a dock, piling,
or anchored mooring. The skills involved are maneuvering the boat to come to a 
stop at the right point, attaching it securely, and detaching and leaving
the mooring safely.

*Anchoring* is temporarily attaching a boat to the ground. The skills involved
are selecting a location, securing the anchor to the bottom and preparing
sufficient scope, and freeing and retrieving the anchor.

The two are sometimes combined, such as when *Mediterranean mooring* with a
bow anchor and stern to a dock, or *tying to shore* by combining an anchor
with one or more lines to rocks and trees.


Dinghies
============================================================================

Dry Sailing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sailing dinghies are typically *dry sailed*, meaning that they are retrieved
from the water after sailing.

Notes on catamarans

### Launching


### Retrieval

- On a dock
- Protected beach with dolly or trailer (dock optional)
- On a beach with a dolly in waves
- Temporarily mooring

Motor Launch

### Launching

### Docking

### Anchoring



Keel Boats
=============================================================================
Boats over 19 feet with ballasted keels usually have engines and
are anchored or moored between sailing sessions, although smaller ones
*trailer sailed* and retrieved with a trailer.

As with smaller boats, keel boats _can_ be moored and anchored under
sail (or sculling/rowing) and traditionally were. However, today's
marinas and anchorages are crowded and the boats are wider (beamier)
than they used to be, so it is now common and courtious to perform
these maneuvers under power whenever possible.
