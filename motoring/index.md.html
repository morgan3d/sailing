                         **Motoring a Sailboat**
                            Updated 2023-04-24

Keelboats often have motors to aid in docking or making way in poor
sailing conditions. This article focuses on maneuvering keelboats with
_inboard_ engines. Motoring is also called auxilliary propulsion for
a sailboat, since the primary means of propulsion is of course sailing.

Engine maintenance and mooring techniques are covered in separate
articles instead of this one. Also not covered in this article are
techniques specific smaller boats with _outboard_ motors. These boats
operate much like slightly awkward motor launches under power and the
techniques described here are not necessary. That is, except for
having to steer with both the engine and tiller, smaller boats are
relatively straightforward to handle under power (once your engine
starts). In a pinch, smaller boats are also amenable to paddling,
sculling with the rudder, and simply being pushed or pulled by hand
off obstructions in a marina.

The key idea of motoring a medium length keelboat is that the
helmsperson must manipulate several sources of force and momentum in
concert to achieve the desired motion. Sailboats under power do not
drive like cars. They don't even drive like busses, which are closer
to the length and mass involved. Putting the transmission in gear and
steering wide turns works for covering distance in open areas, but is
not how to to maneuver a boat within a marina.

The factors involved are the wind and current, the fore-aft thrust of
the propeller, the drag of the rudder, the prop wash redirection of
the rudder, the prop walk, the intertia of the boat, and the linear
and angular momentum of the hull. These can be confusing and
confounding when first encountered, but become essential tools once
understood.

For example, it is a common situation to intentionally be in forward
gear and with the wheel steering to hard to starboard, while actually
moving backwards and rotating to port. In fact, this is part of the
recommended *back and fill* maneuver for changing direction in a
fairway.


Covering Distance

Hull speed, 2500 rpm

Current and windage


Tight Quarters
=========================================================================

Navigating a marina and performing mooring operations under power on a
sailboat is challenging compared to covering large distances. When at
low speed and in areas with restricted maneuverability more factors come
into play.

The strength of the forces applying to a sailboat under power depend
on the design of the boat. Some significant qualities are:

- Single vs. dual rudders. Dual rudders lack prop wash under short forward thrust.
- Strength of prop wash; usually shaft drives have significant prop walk in reverse.
- Keel. Boats with longer keels are harder to turn and spin. Boats with longer keels
  have fewer options in shallow water.
- Windage. Multiple furled headsails, a stack pack main, and stern
  fixtures such as a bimini and solar panels increase the impact of
  wind on a boat in tight quarters.

Navigation depends on motion of the boat relative to fixed
objects. However, steering depends on the motion of the boat relative
to the motion of the water. For example, a sailboat moving at 2 kts
along with a 2 kt current has no ability to steer under power.

The momentum of the boat increases with its mass. It is harder to
start and stop the motion of a heavier boat.

With these factors in mind, the following diagrams show some of the
forces that occur in common situations. The following subsections
discuss why they occur and how to leverage them.


![](normal-steering.svg)

1. *Steering with forward* prop thrust and forward way (relative to
   current): the boat pivots about its keel and steers away from the
   rudder. This is the "normal" case.
2. *Steering with reverse* prop thrust and aft way (relative to
   current): the boat pivots about its keel and steers away from the
   rudder. This is the "normal" backwards case.
   

![](burst.svg width=80%)

2. *Forward burst* of prop thrust, with a _single rudder_, starting from zero boat
   speed: prop _wash_ kicks out the stern, based on the rudder direction.
   On a shaft drive, there will also be a slight kick from the prop
   walk. For the common right-handed prop, this is to starboard when
   thrusting forward.
3. *Reverse burst* of prop thrust _with a shaft drive_, starting from zero boat speed: 
   prop _walk_ kicks out the stern in a fixed direction. For the common 
   right-handed prop, this is to port when thrusting in reverse.
   
   
4. *Motoring into current*: the boat can hold position over ground
   and move laterally by steering.
5. *Motoring with current* with reverse thrust: move forward slowly
   and steer _backwards_, since the boat is moving in reverse relative
   to the current.
6. *Cross current*: boat skids sideways with current.
7. *Cross wind* blows the whole boat laterally and also turns the bow down
   until it reaches the quarter.
8. Turning with wind: turn tightens
9. Turning into wind: turn widens

No steering: 
- Boat moving with current
- Forward thrust burst with dual rudders
- Reverse thrust with saildrive

Prop Wash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Relative to current!
- Normal
- Reverse
- Forward initiates immediately for a single rudder, needs motion for dual rudder

Your prop wash also digs up the bottom of the marina.

Prop Walk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Windage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Most boats will have the bow blown down
- Hard to turn through the wind ("tack")
- If you turn downwind ("running"), may not be able to turn back up
  in strong wind. Drive in reverse or ensure that you always "tack"
  if already upwind


Spinning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Drifting (?)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------






Sources of Thrust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats require water passing over the rudder to to
steer. Generally, one uses only enough power to have steerage and
maintain way against the current and wind _and no more_ when
maneuvering within a marina. For example, keeping speed low enough to
produce no wake and be able to stop quickly (less than 5 kts) when in
main fairway and extremely slow (1-2 kts) when in a secondary fairway
and actually docking.

The larger and heavier the boat, the longer it will take to respond
to direction changes between forward and reverse. While waiting
for the propeller to change the forward-aft movement, wind and current
continue to act on the boat. 

When in reverse, or forward in a boat with dual rudders, the rudder
acts in the direction that the boat is _actually_ going (its
velocity), not the direction that the thrust (acceleration) is
directed/way you _want_ to go.  So, if the boat is moving forward and
the helmsperson shifts into reverse, they must continue steering for
the foward direction until the motion stops and boat actually starts
moving in reverse. 

However, on a boat with a single rudder, even immediately after
shifting into forward there is prop wash over on the rudder which can
be directed as a sort of stern thruster.  This means that while
drifting backwards, the helmsperson can shift into forward with high
throttle to force the stern to slide laterally as if they were moving
forward, even though the boat is still moving backwards.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. A
single single lever system must be shifted into and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.

Fore and aft speed over ground stretches the radius when
turning. Reducing speed by shifting into neutral or reversing
direction to slow the boat as it turns will tighten the turning
radius. Likewise, turning while moving upwind is sharper than while
moving downwind. Of course, some way is required to maintain steerage.
So, if fore and after speed is eliminated to make the sharpest turn,
there is temporarily no steering control. 

It is possible to turn a boat nearly in its own length, which is
necessary when turning around within a narrow fairway. To do this, the
helm must exploit momentum and change directions while turning.  They
pull to the leeward side of the fairway, shift into neutral, and turn
the rudder hard to windward. As the boat turns, it will also get
closer to the windward boats. The helm then reverses thrust briefly,
while keeping the rudder over until the boat begins to move backwards.
At that point the helm throws the rudder the other way. The process
then repeats when the boat gets closer to the leeward side, although
more conservatively there, and continues alternating thrust and rudder
orientation while always maintaining the turn's momentum in the same
direction.

This is called a *three point turn*. In light wind it can be executed
without ever making way in reverse (although the thrust must still be
reversed to stop forward motion temporarily and tighten the turn).  In
heavy wind or a very narrow fairway, it may take many more than three
points to turn.

If the boat has prop walk, prefer to turn in the direction where prop
walk assists the turn. This is turning clockwise, to starboard for a
boat that walks to port in reverse. The turning maneuver is then
called a *back and fill* and can be exceptionally tight.


It is common on recent 35' and larger performance cruisers to have
twin rudders and a sail drive. This configuration is efficient for
motoring forwards long distances and sailing, but can be challenging
to maneuver in tight quarters. It has no prop wash, minimal prop walk,
and often the boat requires significant movement in reverse before
there is any steerage available. 

In my limited personal experience with this configuration, I've found
two strategies the best for moving in reverse. The first is to
initiate turns while moving forward. I use a brief reverse thrust
without changing the helm to halt the forward velocity while
maintaining the turn in place. If the rotation ends earlier than
needed, I give forward thrust without touching the helm. This is like
a back and fill, but does not gain the advantage of prop walk.

The second strategy is to turn the boat around long before reverse is
needed, and back into the side fairway or dock from that long distance.
This requires steering in reverse for longer, but ensures that the
boat has steerage when the critical backing occurs because it was
already in motion.



Fallback Plans
============================================================================

All aspects of sailing require multiple fallback plans and preparation
to enact them immediately in the event of an emergency or other change
of situation. A competent skipper is prepared to immediately take
action while sailing if the boat broaches, an obstruction is sighted,
or any equipment fails.

When docking or picking up a mooring, it is important to assume that 
one might miss the intended landing point or line cast and have a plan
for how to abort the operation and try again.

It is also necessary to prepare to react to unexpected situations that
are beyond the ability of the crew to prevent, as described
below. While sailing, many external problems such as weather or
obstructions can often be recognized some time in advance, and even
equipment failures are frequently slow moving problems that give some
time to consider and react. During docking and marina maneuvers,
problems can arise with little warning or time to respond.

## Escapes

When operating under power, the skipper must constantly be prepared to
escape an unexpected obstruction, an area where the wind or current
have unanticipated strength.

The "unexpected obstruction" could be a rock, a submerged piling, or a
closed off channel or fairway. It is most often a power boat,
paddleboard, or kayak emerging from behind a dock or
breakwater. Lacking masts, those small boats are hard to spot early
and also likely have right of way.

If simply steering around the problem is insufficient, the remaining
choices are stopping, backing away, and turning around. Consider
which you'd use _before_ the need arises and keep an eye on that
"escape" route to ensure it is clear.


## Propulsion Failures

Always be prepared for engine or propeller failure, and have a plan
for how to react. This includes having sails ready to raise any time
you are moving under motor power.

Some likely causes of failure are running out of fuel (due to an
incorrect gauge or the mistake of not checking), the prop being
fouled, a loose propeller not rotating with the shaft, or an engine
failure such as fuel or cooling system clog or broken pump.

Gaining control over the vessel takes priority over restarting the
engine in this situation. Attempting to diagnose and repair the cause
of the failure in time to recover control under power is usually not
realistic.


### Open Water

When motoring in open water, there is generally a lot of time to
respond to a propulsion failure. It is likely safe to drift for a bit
while diagnosing the problem and planning the next move.

However, even in open water the motor may be needed in bad weather to
maintain a safe heading relative to waves. In this case, there are
several natural fallbacks. The first and best is of course to raise
the sails and resume sailing.

If the conditions or rig preclude sailing for some reason, raising the
sails in a reefed condition and heaving to is the next option. Towing
warps or deploying a sea anchor or drogue are heavy weather
alternatives to maintain steerage.

### Partly Constricted

In a mooring field or marina main fairway, you may be able to raise
sail enough to gain steerage and reach clear water. Start with
whichever sail is faster to raise. This is often the jib if it is
already hanked on or is roller furling. This will keep flow over the
rudder to retain steering. Be sure to raise the main sail at the first
opportunity, however, so that you can also change direction when
needed.  At low speed it is impossible to tack many boats using only a
jib because it forces the bow down.

### Tightly Constricted

When against a leeward shore or in a tight spot in a marina, immediately
dropping anchor may be the best way to stop boat motion. This can buy
time to signal for help or repair the motor. It may be possible to
lasso opposing pilings and cleats with dock lines to hold the boat in
place in a fairway. The anchor is likely faster and more foolproof as
a start. If the anchor is on a windlass, make sure that you know how
to release it in the absence of power. This is usually done by
releasing the brake with a winch handle.

In a well-protected marina or in open water under very calm
conditions, the boat can be moved by towing from a dinghy,
sculling with an oar or the rudder, or warping off pilings.


## Sail Failures

A less common failure mode for anchoring or mooring is when the sails
cannot be dropped. Some causes of this are a halyard jamming at the
masthead or inside of the mast, a headsail twisting around another
forestay or instrument, an overridden halyard winch, a jammed halyard
cleat, a sail being caught on a spreader, a furler overriding and
jamming, the main jamming with a broken slide in the track, a battened
main catching on a lazy jack, and a furling main overriding and
jamming inside of the boom or mast.

Depending on the sea and wind conditions, being stuck with a sail up
can vary from annoyance to serious danger. The amount of time to
resolve it and choice of methods will be dictated by the sea
conditions. A jammed furling headsail can be dropped using the halyard
if it is possible to completely unfurl it. A halyard that is jammed at
the bottom can be dropped by cutting the halyard (although--then you have a
catastrophic problem when you need to raise the sail). Often a lightly
jammed furling main or broken slide can be cleared by raising and redropping
under appropriate tension.

In an extreme case, it may be necessary to cut a jammed sail, which is
expensive and dangerous as the free parts fly about in the wind. Or,
it might even be necessary to send crew up the mast. That is dangerous
in wind and waves, with a sail unfurled. There aren't really great
options in some of these situations. Rely on careful inspection,
preventative maintenance, and raising and lowering sails correctly to
avoid these problems happening in the first place and improvise when
needed.


## Judging the Risk

What are the actual chances of needing to execute on a fallback plan
under power or docking? Having to back out of a fairway or dodge an
unexpected vessel is a fairly common occurence in my
experience. Motoring in a marina is like driving a car in busy parking
lot, where you know that others will be backing out and pedestrians
will be dashing between cars all of the time. In this analogy, paddleboarders
and kayakers are the dashing "pedestrians" of a marina.

A lightly jammed headsail that can be freed by pulling it back out and
refurling is also fairly common, especially on a charter boat where
you don't maintain the furler and may not be familiar with its
idiosyncrasies.

How often a furling main jams seems to depend highly on the furling
system and the skipper. Sailor bars and online sailing forums are full
of debate on this point. Claims vary from considering mainsail furling
to be a death trap to insisting that the main can reliably be furled
in a storm.

A tragically timed engine stall is something that doesn't shock me on
an older boat or a smaller one with an outboard, but isn't an everyday
problem. If it is an everyday problem, then you need engine
maintenance! (Or should forget the thing exists and plan to dock
without it.) A well-maintained inboard engine that has just been
inspected, has clean fuel, and is navigating through sufficiently
clean water is not the most likely failure point when motoring through
a marina.

I've had a few halyards jam on small rental keelboats after sailing in
strong wind. This happened from either from the sheave breaking at the
top or the halyard jamming in the cleat at the bottom. I think those
could have been prevented by better inspection and maintenance, as
well as sizing the cleats, blocks, and halyards appropriately. 

I've fortunately never had a halyard jam on boats that I maintained,
but I've learned to carry a rigging knife when on someone else's
keelboat. I'd rather apologize and pay for cutting the halyard than
for sinking the boat.

With proper care in well-known waters, serious grounding is extremely
rare. However, even with careful attention to charts and tide tables,
with enough sailing time it probably a question of _when_, and not
_if_ a grounding will happen--and whether it is a slightly
embarrassing pause on a sandbar or a life threatening catastrophe with
waves pounding against a rocky shore. 

I don't know anyone with significant sailing experience who hasn't
grounded at some point. How often grounding occurs depends on where
and how you sail. My own experiences have been largely with silted-in
channels at low tide and isolated submerged rocks in unfamiliar
waters.

Systems
=========================================================================

Diesel Engine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most 30' and larger keelboats have an internal diesel engine or diesel
generator for either directly driving, or powering via batteries, the
auxilliary propulsion mechanism.

A diesel engine requires a functioning electrical system and power to
start or stop, but not to continue operating. So, one turns on the
engine's electrical system first, then starts the engine, and then
leaves the power on until after the engine is later stopped. In an
emergency, a diesel engine can also be stopped by manually depriving
it of fuel. A diesel engine will not start if it is below about 8
degrees C, so electric *glow plugs* can be used to heat it for a few
seconds when the ambient temperature is cold.

Marine diesel engines use seawater for cooling and will be damaged and
stopped if the cooling system fails. When turning on a marine diesel
engine, immediately listen for the cooling water emerging from the boat.
If it is not, stop the engine and check the filters, stopcocks, hoses,
and water pump/impeller.

Unlike other fuels, diesel is not explosive at normal temperature and
pressure. For example, a match dropped into a bucket of diesel will be
extinuished instead of lighting. Marine diesel (MDO) contains more 
heavy fuel oil than automobile diesel, and is colored red to make
spills and leaks visible. Diesel will float on top of both fresh and
salt water. This includes in the fuel tank--water contamination will
sink to the bottom of the tank.

*Diesel bug* is contamination by bacteria and algae within the fuel
tank.  It is exacerbated by the use of bio-diesel (which is pervasive
today to reduce fossil fuel production) and water in the tank.  It can
be mitigated by keeping the tank clean and nearly full, reducing the
volume available for oxygen and water vapor. Contaminated fuel can be
cleaned by filtering.

Engines have a particular speed (measured in revolutions per minute,
*RPM*), at which they are most efficient. This is typically around
2000-2500 RPM for marine diesels. Engines become radically less
efficient above their target speed. On a boat, increasing the RPMs can
consume fuel 10x faster while gaining relatively little speed,
especially for a non-planing sailboat which is hull-speed limited.
This typically corresponds to motoring at 5-7 kts depending on the
engine and boat to stay in the efficient band.


Shaft Drive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The traditional drive system for a boat is a propeller *shaft*
directly in line with the engine and run out through the hull to a 
*propeller*. The *stuffing box* minimizes the water ingress where
the shaft penetrates the hull, but will *weep* small amounts of water
in normal operation.

![Shaft drive](shaft-drive.jpg width=350px attrib="BoatsNews.com" attrib-url="https://www.boatsnews.com/story/25131/shaft-line-for-sailboats-the-queen-of-propulsions")
The design of a shaft drive is typically constrained such that the
shaft is at a slight downward angle as it exits the hull. This means
that the propeller is not pointing straight backwards but instead
slightly downwards as well. This angle gives rise to *prop walk*,
where varying force exerted by the blades on the bottom and top
creates a lateral force on the stern of the boat. Prop walk is
advantageous for accelerating turns when in a marina, but reduces the
efficiency of motoring straight for long distances.


Mechanical Saildrive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A saildrive is like the shaft and propeller of an outboard engine, but
mounted to the inboard engine. It connects to the back of the engine and
projects downward from the bottom of the hull.

![[Volvo Penta D2 saildrive and engine](https://www.volvopenta.com/marine/leisure-boating/sailboat-solutions/saildrive/)](saildrive.png width=350px)
Saildrives have several advantages over shaft drives, which has led
to their nearly universal application in new boats. Only a handful of
manufacturers use shaft drives today (such as Rustler and Island
Packet).

Saildrives create less vibration and noise underway. They are more
efficient than shaft drives when traveling straight for long
distances. They consume less internal volume, creating more room
for storage and accomodation. The seals do not weep and are less likely
to leak than a stuffing box, keeping the bilge drier.

![Saildrive projecting from hull](saildrive-exterior.jpg width=350px attrib="Yachting Monthly" attrib-url="https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/essential-saildrive-checks-for-your-boat-77913")
There are also drawbacks of saildrives compared to shaft drives.  They
require professional maintenance every 5-10 years. The enclosure is
made from aluminum, and requires sacrificial anodes and frequent
monitoring to avoid corrosion. The relatively minimal prop walk in
reverse makes turning more difficult by precluding the back-and-fill
maneuver, perhaps requiring a bow thruster to compensate on longer
boats. The through-hull hole for a saildrive is very large compared to
a propellor shaft hole. It is sealed by a major gasket and has a
separate leak alarm.


Electric Saildrive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electric saildrives, such as [Oceanvolt Sail Drive](https://oceanvolt.com/solutions/systems/sail-drive/), are not mechanically coupled
to the engine. They instead use electric motors to power a saildrive.

This fully unconstrains the location of the generator, or allows
removing the generator entirely if an alternative source of power such
as solar and large batteries is available. While sailing, the
propeller can also be used for regeneration, creating a small amount
of drag and recharging the batteries.

Electric saildrives are nearly silent and allow operation with the
generator off. They provide power instantly and do not require the
careful spin up time of a mechanical drive to reach high amounts of
thrust. They also allow the generator to be run at its most efficient
RPMs independent of the speed of the propeller.

![Systems devoted to propulsion for an Oceanvolt SD installation](oceanvolt.jpg attrib="Oceanvolt" attrib-url="https://oceanvolt.com/solutions/systems/sail-drive/")

The primary downside of electric saildrives is that they are a bit
ahead of their time for most sailors. Their power requirements in turn
lead to the necessity of LiFePO4 batteries, which creates a complex
and relatively new system compared to the less expensive, proven, and
easy to repair/source parts for diesel engine and AGM batteries.

On monohulls, it is difficult to achieve sufficient power for
recharging without using diesel. A large catamaran has enough
coachroof and deck area to use solar. This means that monohulls with
electric saildrives are still using diesel generators (reducing many
of the electric advantages), required to recharge by shore power
frequently, or dominated by power conservation concerns when operated.


Propellers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A propeller's efficiency depends on the number of blades, their size,
and their angle of attack. Sailboat propellers usually fold when not
in use to reduce drag, which tends to restrict them to two
blades. Even rigid props typically have three blades to reduce
their drag under sail.

Propellers must be protected from galvanic corrosion by sacrificial
anodes. For salt water, these are made from zinc and so are often
called "zincs".

Propellers are vulnerable to catching loose lines in the water. High
risks are a boat's own docking lines and sheets, fishing lines, and
nets. Snagging a line can immediately disable a propeller. The
helmsperson should constantly check for loose lines and be paranoid
about lines falling in the water. A *linecutter* attachment on the end 
of the shaft is a circular set of blades that can sometimes protect
the propellor by shredding lines that are encountered moving from bow
to stern.

A recent [research design](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/other/doc/2023-02/TVO_Technology_Highlight_41_Toroidal_Propeller.pdf) for propellers eliminates the tip vortex drag
by using a toroidal shape that has no tips on the blades.
Unfortunately, this is not practical for a sailboat folding prop.


Thrusters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A *bow thruster* provides lateral force at the bow. It is typically a
propeller with an electric motor mounted in a tunnel at the bow. This
can be used for turning the boat while docking. Most modern boats over
40' use bow thrusters because their heavy mass makes them hard to turn
tightly.

![Bow thruster in tunnel](bowthruster.jpg width=350px)
A bow thruster can also drop down from a compartment in the bow. This
reduces drag under sail. The drawback is that it is more likely to
catch lines and seaweed, is a part that can fail, and there is more
delay to engaging the thruster.

Less common on sailboats are *stern thrusters*, which typically drop
down in the stern. Using both bow and stern thrusters enables translational
movement away from a dock on very large boats and can enhance the ability
to spin in place.

[*Jet thrusters*](https://www.jetthruster.com/) are like a jetski, and pump sea water through at high
speed to create thrust. The drawback of these is that they pump
seawater at high speed through the boat, which is a high risk if a
hose breaks loose. A typical bow thruster has only a very small
through-hull connection for the electrical wires and is otherwise
completely sealed outside the boat, eliminating the risk of leaks.
