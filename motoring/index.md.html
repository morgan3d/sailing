                         **Motoring a Sailboat**

Keelboats often have motors to aid in docking or making way in poor
sailing conditions. This article focuses on maneuvering keelboats with
_inboard_ engines. 

Motoring is also called *auxilliary propulsion* for
a sailboat, since the primary means of propulsion is of course sailing.
It is prudent to keep in mind that motoring is auxilliary. I
personally wouldn't leave the dock in any boat where I wasn't
confident I could also return without a motor.

The key idea of motoring a medium length keelboat is that the
helmsperson must manipulate several sources of force and momentum in
concert to achieve the desired motion. Sailboats under power do not
drive like cars. They don't even drive like busses, which are closer
to the length and mass involved. Putting the transmission in gear and
steering wide turns works for covering distance in open areas, but is
not how to maneuver a boat within a marina.

The factors involved are the wind and current, the fore-aft thrust of
the propeller, the drag of the rudder, the prop wash redirection of
the rudder, the prop walk, the intertia of the boat, and the linear
and angular momentum of the hull. These can be confusing and
confounding when first encountered, but become essential tools once
understood.

For example, it is a common situation to intentionally be in forward
gear and with the wheel steering to hard to starboard, while actually
moving backwards and rotating to port. In fact, this is part of the
[*back and fill*](https://www.sail-world.com/Australia/Sailing-boat-handling-Back-and-fill-using-prop-walk/-106819) 
maneuver for turning significant amounts in place within a fairway.

Engine maintenance and mooring (docking and anchoring) techniques are
covered in separate articles instead of this one. Also not covered in
this article are techniques specific smaller boats with _outboard_
motors. These boats operate much like slightly awkward motor launches
under power and the techniques described here are not necessary. That
is, except for having to steer with both the engine and tiller,
smaller boats are relatively straightforward to handle under power
(once your engine starts). In a pinch, smaller boats are also amenable
to paddling, sculling with the rudder, and simply being pushed or
pulled by hand off obstructions in a marina.

I focus here on monohull sailboats with a single drive. Large
sailboats with twin props and catamarans handle differently and have
additional options and concerns.

Navigation Rules
=====================================================================

When propelled by a motor, a boat must follow powerboat navigation
regulations. These apply when motorsailing as well as when the sails
are completely down. The most significant change is that it must give
way to sailboats under sail and other unpowered craft.

If the sails are up and engine is running _but not in gear_, for
example, as a backup or to charge batteries, then the boat technically
is under sail propusion. 

However, the boat with the engine running should still give way to
other sailboats in practice. It has immediate access to increased
maneuverability from the engine, which is the intent of the navigation
rules. Also, when another sailboat hears the engine running, they will
assume that the boat with the engine is making way under power and
expect it to keep clear.

Lights
------------------------------------------------------------------------

![ ](lights.jpg width=250px attrib-url="https://www.westmarine.com/west-advisor/Navigation-Light-Rules.html" attrib="West Marine")
At night or in poor visibility a sailboat under power must run a
navigation *steaming light*. This is a white forward light on the mast
covering 225 degrees. 

On the breaker panel where the navigation lights are turned on, there
will will be a switch to toggle them between "sail" and "steaming" (or
"power"). Remember to change the switch _back_ to "sail" when you stop
the engine and resume sailing.


Sound Signals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When boats meet and need to deviate from the default navigation rules
or need quick emergency communication, they signal with sound signals
on a horn or whistle. The signals are:

- One short blast = "I’m altering my course to starboard"
- Two short blasts = "I’m altering my course to port"
- Three short blasts = "I’m operating my boat in reverse"
- Five rapid blasts = "I’m unsure of your intentions!", usually to avert a collision and with a measure of in panic from a small boat or anger from a large one.
- One long blast = "My boat is longer than 12m and leaving the dock under power" i.e., "get out of my way, I can't turn or stop quickly"

Technically, one should sound three short blasts _whenever_ reversing
away from a dock or mooring. However, this is usually frowned on in
locations where it would disturb neighbors on the water and land. You
will most often hear the reversing signal only from ferries or cargo
ships. Use your judgement if there is obviously no risk of other small
boats not noticing your movement.

Beware that there are special signal interpretations on the Great Lakes.

In restricted visibility, such as fog, make the following signals repeatedly:

- One long blast followed by two short blasts every two minutes = "I'm here and under sail"
- One long blast every two minutes = "I'm here under power".
- Rapid blasts for five seconds, every minute = "I'm at anchor" (or aground).


Right of Way
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When boats meet, there is a *stand on* vessel that is required to
maintain its current course and speed, and a *give way* vessel that is
required to keep clear. Sailors often casually refer to the stand on
vessel as having "right of way", but keep in mind that it is not free
to change during the passing time as then the other vessel cannot
anticipate its actions.

Boats under power must give way and keep clear of boats under sail or
human propulsion unless they are overtaking. That includes
windsurfers, paddleboarders, and kayaks.

For boats under power, the rules are the same as for cars (in
drive-on-the-right countries) and thus easy to remember:

1. Go on green, change course on red or white
2. Drive on the right side head on or in a restricted lane

![Incomming vessel on your port =<br>You see green = Stand on!](seeing-starboard.svg height=300) ![Incomming vessel on your starboard =<br>You see red = Keep clear!](seeing-port.svg height=300)
![Keep clear when overtaking.](overtaking.svg height=300) ![Pass port-to-port if head on.](port-to-port.svg height=300)

When two boats under power meet, their interactions are generally
governed by a simple observation. Where is the other boat relative to
yours? If it is approaching on your forward port quarter extended a
bit past the port beam, then you are on the stand-on vessel. Otherwise
you are the keep-clear vessel because they're on your port side or
you're overtaking (or both).

A boat approaching your port aft quarter is either within your port
light or stern light arc. So, you are the stand-on vessel, because it
is either approaching your port or your stern.

The tricky case is a boat approaching your starboard aft quarter, very
close to 112.5 degrees off your bow (22.5 degrees aft of your beam).
Depending on the exact bearing, they are either within white stern
light arc and overtaking (and you are the stand on vessel), or within
your green starboard light arc (and you are the give way vessel). If
they are sufficiently distant and not approaching too rapidly, then
altering course a bit to port might be
a smart move in this situation. This makes them clearly the give way
vessel that should then pass behind you.

In any situation where an oncoming boat's intentions are unclear
or you believe they are not fulfilling their role under the rules, 
you should also:

1. Sound five rapid sound signals: "Your intentions are unclear!"
2. Hail, if you can access the radio quickly enough or shout clearly enough.
3. Take whatever steps you believe will best avert the collision based
   on the situation, including making decisive and obvious course changes.

!!! Note Traffic Light Analogy
   It may help to think of the light signals like a traffic light. *The
   stand-on vessel is facing the give-way vessel's green, starboard
   navigation light*, assuming both boats are under forward
   propulsion. In all other cases the give-way vessel is facing the
   white, stern light or the red, port light on the stand-on vessel.

   If you can see a green light, that's your sign to stand on.
   Otherwise, you should keep clear because you're approaching their port
   side (red light) or stern (white light). Of course, during the day you
   cannot see the lights. In that case you need to visualize it and
   determine if you are approaching within 112.5 degrees off the bow.

   Of course, if the approaching vessel is on your beam, you will see
   _both_ their red and green navigation lights. So, you do have to remember
   that them approaching on your port side means they keep clear, and them
   approaching on your starboard side means that you keep clear. However,
   if a vessel is approaching on your beam from some distance then you are
   probably not on a collision course.

In a fairway or channel, boats under power pass port to port unless
they have signalled each other to do otherwise. This means that you
drive on the starboard (right) side of a channel or fairway. This is
the same as a car on a road in a non UK-convention country. It also
means that while passing, both are facing a red light and it is
obvious that they shouldn't turn into each other.

There are power navigation rule exceptions for special situations with
working boats, especially large ones. These include active fishing
boats, tugs, ferries, dredges, tow boats, cruise ships, and cargo
ships. These exceptions are the same under sail.

And finally, the navigation rules (COLREGS) require everyone to avoid
collisions regardless of who is supposed to be the stand on vessel:

> When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and 
> speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by 
> the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action
> as will best aid to avoid collision.


Covering Distance
=========================================================================

Motoring is obviously not the preferred way to cover long distances in
a sailboat.  However, firing up the engine can be necessary when
fighting current, trapped without wind, or running short on daylight.

Steering in open water under power is easy and the boat mostly acts
like a very large, very noisy, and very slow car. The primary
considerations when covering large distances are how long it will take
and how much fuel will be consumed.


Fuel Consumption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diesel engines have a particular speed, measured in revolutions per
minute, *RPM*, at which they are most efficient. This is typically
around 2000-2500 RPM for marine diesels. Engines become radically less
efficient above their target speed.

On a boat, increasing the RPM can consume fuel as much as 10x faster
while gaining relatively little speed, especially for a non-planing
sailboat which is limited by its hull speed. The efficient speed
tends to correspond to moving at 5-7 kts through the water.


Current and Wind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When planning time and fuel consumption, the current and wind can
affect the boat both positively and negatively. When they are with the
boat, it can exceed its hull speed over ground and efficiently cover a
larger distance. 

When current and wind oppose the boat, fuel consumption will rise.
Fighting a 5 kt current or strong headwind might require the engine at
4000 RPM to make headway and still only yield 2 kts of forward motion
in exchange for significant fuel consumption.

Flying sails, furled sails, biminies, dodgers, and solar panels all
contribute to the boat's windage. Beyond furling, there is often little
that can be done to adjust this on short notice. Of course, the motor is
rarely needed for long distances on a sailboat when there is wind. But with
little true wind, the apparent wind when motoring will still increase fuel
consumption.

As with sailing, a cross wind can also create leeway that must be
compensated for when motoring. Because of its keel, a sailboat may
experience less leeway and track better than a motorboat in similar
conditions.

When planning a trip, factor in the likely wind and current when under
power and adjust estimates accordingly.


Motorsailing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A Garcia 45 sailboat motorsailing](motorsail.jpg width=350px attrib="Yachting Monthly" attrib-url="https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/why-motor-sailing-is-good-seamanship-72810")
Motorsailing is what it sounds like, keeping the sails (typically just the main) up while motoring.
The presence of the sail can act as a stabilizing force. More often, one began by sailing
and engaged the motor when the breeze became too light or from an unfavorable direction.
Keeping the main sail up can gain a bit of extra speed. 

When motorsailing, the apparent wind will shift ahead because of the
extra propulsion.  The main must usually be trimmed in as if close
hauled regardless of the true wind direction.

If the wind is too light, motorsailing is less efficient than simply
motoring because the drag from the main exceeds the lift that it
provides.

![Fisher 30 motorsailer](fisher30.jpg width=350px attrib-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fisher30.jpg" attrib="&copy; 2008 Tonkie CC-SA 3.0")
Some sailboats are specifically designed as *motorsailers* to frequently
operate in motorsailing mode. These usually have a
trawler-like design with a wide hull, flat bottom, and protected above deck
pilothouse or saloon. Although aesthetically and morally offensive to many
sailors, this is a practical solution for many types of cruising and
regions.  That includes areas with low wind or frequent bad weather.
A motorsailer combines the speed, range, accomodation volume, and
electrical liberties of a powerboat with the failsafe and efficiency
advantages of a sailboat.


Tight Quarters
=========================================================================

![Multiple turns under power through tight fairways are required in marinas.](marina.jpg attrib="Van Isle Marina" attrib-url="https://vanislemarina.com/")

Navigating a marina and performing mooring operations under power on a
sailboat is challenging. Because these tasks require moving at low
speed and in areas with restricted maneuverability, more factors come
into play.

The strength of the forces applying to a sailboat under power depend
on the design of the boat. Some significant qualities are:

Single vs. dual rudders
: Dual rudders lack prop wash under forward burst thrust.

Strength of prop walk
: Shaft drives usually have more significant prop walk in reverse.

Keel shape
: Boats with longer keel chord lengths are harder to turn and spin in
  place. Boats with deeper keels have fewer options in shallow water.

: Windage 
  Multiple furled headsails, a stack pack main, and stern
  fixtures such as a bimini and solar panels increase the impact of
  wind on a boat in tight quarters and the efficiency of motoring
  long distances.

Navigation depends on motion of the boat relative to fixed
objects. However, _steering_ depends on the motion of the boat
relative to the motion of the water. For example, a sailboat moving at
2 kts along with a 2 kt current has no ability to steer under power.


The momentum of the boat increases with its mass. It is harder to
start and stop the motion of a heavier boat.

Elemental Cases
-----------------------------------------------------------

![](normal-steering.svg width=88%) ![](burst.svg width=70%)
![](current.svg) ![](wind.svg width=80%)

                         - - -

The following diagrams show some of the elemental cases that arise
under auxilliary propulsion. The next subsections discuss why they
occur and how to leverage them to achieve effective maneuvers. With an
understanding of these and remembering that the boat pivots around the
keel, maneuvering in tight quarters can become mostly intuitive.


![](normal-steering.svg width=88%)

1. *Steering with forward* prop thrust and forward way (relative to
   current): the boat pivots about its keel and steers away from the
   rudder. This is the "normal" case in forward gear.
2. *Steering with reverse* prop thrust and aft way (relative to
   current): the boat pivots about its keel and steers towards the
   rudder. This is the "normal" case in reverse gear.
   
As with a car, steering backwards can be confusing. Step around to the
other side of the wheel and face the stern, and then both the throttle
and wheel act in the expected direction. Steering a boat in reverse
this way can be even easier than in forward. There's unobstructed
visibility and the helmsperson is closer to the edge of the boat to
judge distances. The rest of the boat follows wherever the stern has
passed through, like a snake.

   
                           - - -
                     
![](burst.svg width=70%)

3. *Forward burst* of prop thrust, with a _single rudder_, starting
   from zero boat speed: prop _wash_ kicks out the stern, based on the
   rudder direction.  On a shaft drive, there will also be a slight
   kick from the prop walk. For the common right-handed prop, this is
   to starboard when thrusting forward, so starboard bursts will
   be more effective than port ones.
4. *Reverse burst* of prop thrust _with a shaft drive_, starting from
   zero boat speed: prop _walk_ kicks out the stern in a fixed
   direction independent of the rudder setting. For the common
   right-handed prop, this direction is to port when thrusting in
   reverse.

                           - - -
   
![](current.svg)

5. *Current from ahead* with forward thrust: the boat can hold position over ground
   and move laterally by steering.
6. *Current from astern* with reverse thrust: the boat can hold position over ground
   and move laterally by steering _backwards_, since the boat in reverse relative
   to the current.
7. *Cross current*: the boat skids sideways with the current.

                           - - -

![](wind.svg width=80%)

8. *Turning off the wind* ("falling off" direction): the turn tightens because the bow is blown down.
9. *Turning into the wind* ("heading up" direction): the turn widens because the bow resists the turn.
10. *Cross wind* blows the whole boat laterally and also turns the boat by blowing the bow down until it reaches the quarter.


                           - - -

No steering via the rudder is possible in the following cases: 

11. *Moving with the current*: if the boat is moving at the same speed
    as the current over ground, then it is not moving relative to the water
    and there is no wash over the rudder, so it cannot steer.
12. *Forward burst with dual rudders* while stopped: the wash
    passes between the rudders. There is no steering possible until
    the boat begins to move relative to the water.
13. *Reverse burst with a saildrive* while stopped: there is minimal
    prop walk, so until the boat begins to move astern and generates wash
    over the rudder there is no steering.



Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to a dock to leverage lines ashore. Some boats also have bow
and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats require a *wash* of moving water passing
over the rudder to steer. When the entire boat is moving relative to
the water, this is maintained. 

Independent of boat movement, a brief *burst* of thrust from revving
the motor for a short time can create a local wash over the rudder.
This localized moving water also deflects the rudder as a form of 
thruster.

Generally, one uses only enough power to have steerage and maintain
way against the current and wind _and no more_ when maneuvering within
a marina. For example, keeping speed low enough to produce no wake and
be able to stop quickly (less than 5 kts) when in main fairway and
extremely slow (1-2 kts) when in a secondary fairway and actually
docking.

The larger and heavier the boat, the longer it will take to respond
to direction changes between forward and reverse. While waiting
for the propeller to change the forward-aft movement, wind and current
continue to act on the boat. 

When in reverse, or forward in a boat with dual rudders, the rudder
acts in the direction that the boat is _actually_ going (its
velocity), not the direction that the thrust (acceleration) is
directed/the way you _want_ to go. So, if the boat is moving forward
and the helmsperson shifts into reverse, they must continue steering
for the foward direction until the motion stops and boat actually
starts moving in reverse.

However, on a boat with a single rudder, even immediately after
shifting into forward there is prop wash over on the rudder. That can
be directed by the rudder as a sort of stern thruster. This means that
while drifting backwards, the helmsperson can shift into forward with
a high throttle to suddenly force the stern to slide laterally as if
they were moving forward, even though the boat is still moving
backwards.

Older systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. For
a single single lever system, shift slowly down to neutral and hold it
for a few seconds before changing direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
is the phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
force on the stern because the upstroke side of the propeller cycle
is slightly more effective than the downstroke. The effect is
significantly stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
drives. 

The direction of prop walk depends on the orientation of the
propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
in reverse and to starboard in forward. Depending on the vessel,
prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so strong that a
boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
is the flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
motion relative to the water current.

*Thrusters* are electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply
brief lateral thrust while docking. Single *bow thrusters* are most
common on sailboats, usually those above 35' in length. Additional
*stern thrusters* appear on even larger boats. A single thruster is
useful for turning with a small radius. Two thrusters can allow
turning in place as well as lateral movement without requiring a turn.


## Turning in Place

Fore and aft speed over ground stretches the radius when
turning. Reduce speed by shifting into neutral or reversing direction
to slow the boat and tighten the turning radius. Turning while moving
upwind is also sharper than while moving downwind because the bow is
blown by the wind in the desired direction and because the wind is
helping to slow the boat and tighten the turn. Of course, one cannot
go too slowly because some way is required to maintain steerage.

### Three Point Turn
With care, it is possible to turn a boat within nearly its own
length. This is necessary when turning around within a narrow
fairway. To do this, the helmsperson must exploit momentum and change
thrust directions while maintaining the turning motion, as well as
leverage the wind. They pull to the leeward side of the fairway, shift
into neutral, and turn the rudder hard to windward. As the boat turns,
it will also get closer to the windward boats. The helm then reverses
thrust briefly, while keeping the rudder over until the boat begins to
move backwards. At that point the helmsperson throws the rudder the
other way. The process then repeats when the boat gets closer to the
leeward side, although more conservatively there, and continues
alternating thrust and rudder orientation while always maintaining the
turn's momentum in the same direction.

This is called a *three point turn*. In light wind it can be executed
without ever making way in reverse (although the thrust must still be
reversed to stop forward motion temporarily and tighten the turn). In
heavy wind or a very narrow fairway, it may take many more than three
points to turn.

### Back and Fill

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5f2LScC0TQ)

If the boat has significant prop walk, ignore the wind and instead
prefer to turn in the direction where prop walk assists the turn. This
is turning to starboard (i.e., clockwise) for a boat with a common
right-handed prop that walks to port in reverse. The turning maneuver
is then called a *back and fill* and can be exceptionally tight.  Note
that prop walk fights the forward part of the turn and supports the
reverse part. Usually the prop walk is more significant in reverse.

### Twin Rudders and Sail Drive

![Twin rudders on a Pogo 36](twinrudder.jpg width=350px attrib="SAIL Magazine" attrib-url="https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/boat-handling-docking-with-twin-rudders")
Some recent performance cruisers pair twin rudders with a sail
drive. This configuration is efficient for sailing and for motoring
forwards long distances. However, it can be challenging to maneuver in
tight quarters. Such a boat has no prop wash and minimal prop walk. 
Often the boat requires significant movement in reverse before there
is any steerage available. It may require 5-10 seconds in reverse and
cover 3 meters of distance before the boat can be steered.

In my limited personal experience with this configuration, I've found
two strategies the best for maneuvering in reverse. The first is to
initiate turns while moving forward, before changing direction. I use
a brief reverse thrust without changing the helm to halt the forward
velocity while maintaining the turn in place. If the rotation ends
earlier than needed, I give forward thrust without touching the
helm. This is like a back-and-fill, but does not gain the advantage of
prop walk.

The second strategy is to turn the boat around long before reverse is
needed, and back into the side fairway or dock from that long distance.
This requires steering in reverse for longer, but ensures that the
boat has steerage when the critical backing occurs because it was
already in motion.


Challenges with Current
-----------------------------------------------------------

Current is rarely the dominant factor in tight maneuvers, and 1-2 kts
of cross current or powering into current is easy to compensate
for. There are three exceptions where it can get tricky, however.

One exception is navigating narrow or obstructed tidal channels, such
as in the northern reaches of the [Salish sea](https://salishseapilot.com/) or tidal fjords.

Another exception is an estuary or river marina where [current flows straight
through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9tCrkcJQPo), such as found in the UK. 

In both of those cases, 5 kts or more might be experienced at maximum
ebb or flood and become the dominant factor. Of course, one common
strategy in each of those cases is to time one's maneuver close to
slack water at high tide to avoid the current completely.

The third tricky situation with current can occur even within
protected marinas. It is an example of elemental case #11
above. When the current is at docking speeds (1-3 kts) and pushing the
boat into the slip or fairway, there is no steerage available because
the water is moving with the boat over ground at the same speed. Two
undesirable options are to move faster over ground than desired, or to
periodically reverse thrust direction (case #6) and pull away from the
destination in order to get wash relative to the current and
reposition the boat.


Crosswind Docking Examples
-----------------------------------------------------------

When pulling in or out of a slip or narrow fairway with a significant
crosswind, the impact of wind on the bow in particular must be taken
into account. This often requires selecting the turn direction based
on the wind and instead of the target path. That is, don't drive the
boat as if it were a car.

Here are some examples of how the elements previously discussed can be
combined to empower the skipper instead of fighting them.

### Departure

![Successful cross-wind departure.](crosswind-depart.svg) In the
figure on the right, the boat begins in its slip at *(a)* and is docked
stern-to, off a narrow fairway. A strong cross wind is blowing in from the starboard
side of the boat. If the skipper attempts to turn to starboard as they
leave the slip, they will be turning into the wind. The cross wind
will blow the bow down and widen or prevent the turn before the skipper
can clear the opposite side.

A solution is to instead turn at *(b)* _away_ from the main fairway,
driving deeper into the narrow side fairway. The cross wind will
help with this turn, making it very sharp. 

Assuming port prop walk in reverse for this example, the skipper turns
slightly past 90 degrees. They do this so that when they apply reverse
thrust at *(c)*, the prop walk straightens the boat in the
side fairway. They then back out to the main fairway. If the boat had
starboard prop walk then they would have turned more than 90 degrees,
and if the prop walk was negligible then turning until directly aligned
would be fine.

At *(d)*, they initiate a relatively wide turn in reverse fighting
against the wind. Again, the skipper intentionally over turns, ending pointed 
slightly towards the wind at *(e)*, and getting close to the windward dock. 

This positioning at *(e)* anticipates that the cross wind will blow
the boat slightly, pushing it to port and turning the bow down while
the skipper is waiting for the forward thrust to accelerate the boat
out of the main fairway. 

                           - - -
                           
Depending on the conditions and boat, two alternatives could be
employed for leaving the slip in this scenario. In light wind, the
skipper could perform a 180 degree back and fill turn at *(c)* to
leave the narrow side fairway facing forwards and achieve a tight turn
onto the main fairway with the wind helping. Or, in strong wind, they
could back out of the marina the entire way, never fighting the cross
breeze.

### Arrival

![Successful cross-wind arrival.](crosswind-arrive.svg)
In the figure on the right, the boat enters the marina at *(a)*
with forward way and a cross wind from the port side. 

When 
aligned with the fairway, the skipper turns through about
160 degrees in place at *(b)*. There are two choices for that turn.
With a strong prop walk to port in reverse, it would be easier to
initiate the turn to starboard, clockwise. In the absence of 
strong prop walk, turning to port is easier because the initial
portion of the turn has higher velocity, which is helpful for bringing
the bow up into the wind.

The turn is slightly less than 180 degrees so that the bow is pointing
a bit upwind at *(c)*. Then, the skipper lets the boat blow down to its
slip, and reverses into the slip at *(d)*.

                                 - - -

![Successful cross-wind arrival<br>deeper in the fairway.](crosswind-arrive2.svg)
If the target slip were further down the fairway, a long drift sideways
could be hard to control. In that situation, the alternative shown
on the right could be used. 

Here, the initial turn is separated into two parts. At *(b)* the boat
only turns about 90 degrees, and then lets itself be blown backwards
down the fairway, able to steer. 

At *(c)*, the skipper completes the turn. From the helm position, it
looks as though they are turning too early and aiming to back into the
slip upwind of theirs, or maybe the finger dock between slips. That is
because while backing towards the slip, the boat will continue to be
blown downwind and the bow will continue to turn. The skipper has to
anticipate this by aiming for an upwind spot.

Note that prop walk is not a factor for this final turn. The boat has
been underway in reverse down the length of the narrow fairway, so has
full steerage and may not even be using reverse thrust.

                                 - - -

I would consider two alternatives for this scenario if the wind was very
strong, to avoid the initial turn. The first is to simply dock bow-to,
avoiding having to turn so far. For the first slip, no turn at all is needed
in this case. 

The second alternative is to back into the marina from the start,
avoiding the initial turn if docking stern-to at the
upwind slip, and avoiding ever coming to a stop with a three point turn
when targeting the downwind slip. A large turn while stopped can be difficult
in the presence of wind because there is no steering available at the stopped
time but the wind will continue to act.


Fallback Plans
============================================================================

All aspects of sailing require multiple fallback plans and preparation
to enact them immediately in the event of an emergency or other change
of situation. A competent skipper is prepared to immediately take
action while sailing if the boat broaches, an obstruction is sighted,
or any equipment fails.

When docking or picking up a mooring, it is important to assume that 
one might miss the intended landing point or line cast and have a plan
for how to abort the operation and try again.

It is also necessary to prepare to react to unexpected situations that
are beyond the ability of the crew to prevent, as described
below. While sailing, many external problems such as weather or
obstructions can often be recognized some time in advance, and even
equipment failures are frequently slow moving problems that give some
time to consider and react. During docking and marina maneuvers,
problems can arise with little warning or time to respond.

## Escapes

When operating under power, the skipper must constantly be prepared to
escape an unexpected obstruction, an area where the wind or current
have unanticipated strength.

The "unexpected obstruction" could be a rock, a submerged piling, or a
closed off channel or fairway. It is most often a power boat,
paddleboard, or kayak emerging from behind a dock or
breakwater. Lacking masts, those small boats are hard to spot early
and also likely have right of way.

If simply steering around the problem is insufficient, the remaining
choices are stopping, backing away, and turning around. Consider
which you'd use _before_ the need arises and keep an eye on that
"escape" route to ensure it is clear.


## Propulsion Failures

Always be prepared for engine or propeller failure, and have a plan
for how to react. This includes having sails ready to raise any time
you are moving under motor power.

Some likely causes of failure are running out of fuel (due to an
incorrect gauge or the mistake of not checking), the prop being
fouled, a loose propeller not rotating with the shaft, or an engine
failure such as fuel or cooling system clog or broken pump.

Gaining control over the vessel takes priority over restarting the
engine in this situation. Attempting to diagnose and repair the cause
of the failure in time to recover control under power is usually not
realistic.


### Open Water

When motoring in open water, there is generally a lot of time to
respond to a propulsion failure. It is likely safe to drift for a bit
while diagnosing the problem and planning the next move.

However, even in open water the motor may be needed in bad weather to
maintain a safe heading relative to waves. In this case, there are
several natural fallbacks. The first and best is of course to raise
the sails and resume sailing.

If the conditions or rig preclude sailing for some reason, raising the
sails in a reefed condition and heaving to is the next option. Towing
warps or deploying a sea anchor or drogue are heavy weather
alternatives to maintain steerage.

The time honored solution to propulsion failure in heavy weather is to
raise sails and heave to, allowing you to wait out a storm or work
on the engine and fuel system in relative safety.

### Partly Constricted

In a mooring field or marina main fairway, you may be able to raise
sail enough to gain steerage and reach clear water. Start with
whichever sail is faster to raise. This is often the jib if it is
already hanked on or is roller furling. Gaining some acceleration from
a sail will retain flow over the
rudder to allow steering. 

Be sure to raise the main sail at the first opportunity, however, so
that you can also change direction when needed. At low speed it is
impossible to tack many boats using only a jib because it forces the
bow down.

Of course, moving with full, trimmed sails within a marina would
produce too much speed. Let the sails luff partly and keep them at the
third reef point or smaller.


### Tightly Constricted

When against a leeward shore or in a tight spot in a marina, immediately
dropping anchor may be the best way to stop boat motion. This can buy
time to signal for help or repair the motor. It may be possible to
lasso opposing pilings and cleats with dock lines to hold the boat in
place in a fairway. The anchor is likely faster and more foolproof as
a start. If the anchor is on a windlass, make sure that you know how
to release it in the absence of power. This is usually done by
releasing the brake with a winch handle.

In a well-protected marina or in open water under very calm
conditions, the boat can be moved by towing from a dinghy,
sculling with an oar or the rudder, or warping off pilings.

In the worst case, intentionally grounding at a safe location such 
as a sand bar may be preferable to being blown onto rocks or into
other boats.


## Sail Failures

A less common failure mode for anchoring or mooring is when the sails
cannot be dropped after the motor is engaged. Some causes of this are
a halyard jamming at the masthead or inside of the mast, a headsail
twisting around another forestay or instrument, an overridden halyard
winch, a jammed halyard cleat, a sail being caught on a spreader, a
furler overriding and jamming, the main jamming with a broken slide in
the track, a battened main catching on a lazy jack, and a furling main
overriding and jamming inside of the boom or mast.

Depending on the sea and wind conditions, being stuck with a sail up
can vary from annoyance to serious danger. The amount of time to
resolve it and choice of methods will be dictated by the sea
conditions. A jammed furling headsail can be dropped using the halyard
if it is possible to completely unfurl it. A halyard that is jammed at
the bottom can be dropped by cutting the halyard (although--then you have a
catastrophic problem when you need to raise the sail). Often a lightly
jammed furling main or broken slide can be cleared by raising and redropping
under appropriate tension.

In an extreme case, it may be necessary to cut a jammed sail
free. This is not just expensive to repair later but also immediately
dangerous, as the free parts fly about in the wind. It may also
be necessary to send crew up the mast to free a jammed halyard or cut a sail free. 
That is dangerous in wind and waves, with a sail unfurled. The masthead will swing
as the boat rolls, throwing the crew around and risking collision with the mast or stays,
and the sails will luff into the crew.

There aren't really great options in some of these situations. Rely on
careful inspection, preventative maintenance, and raising and lowering
sails correctly to avoid them happening in the first place.  Then,
improvise when needed.


## Judging the Risk

What are the actual chances of needing to execute on a fallback plan
under power or docking? Having to back out of a fairway or dodge an
unexpected vessel is a fairly common occurence in my
experience. Motoring in a marina is like driving a car in busy parking
lot, where you know that others will be backing out and pedestrians
will be dashing between cars all of the time. In this analogy,
paddleboarders and kayakers are the dashing "pedestrians" of a marina.

A lightly jammed headsail that can be freed by pulling it back out and
refurling is also fairly common, especially on a charter boat where
you don't maintain the furler and may not be familiar with its
idiosyncrasies.

How often a furling main jams seems to depend highly on the furling
system and the skipper. Sailor bars and online sailing forums are full
of debate on this point. Claims vary from considering mainsail furling
to be a death trap to insisting that the main can reliably be furled
in a storm.

A tragically timed engine stall is something that doesn't shock me on
an older boat or a smaller one with an outboard, but isn't an everyday
problem. If it is an everyday problem, then you need engine
maintenance! (Or, forget the thing exists and always plan to dock
without it.) A well-maintained inboard engine that has just been
inspected, has clean fuel, and is navigating through sufficiently
clean water is not the most likely failure point when motoring through
a marina. Maybe one in fifty times there will be an unwelcome surprise here.

A jammed or loose propeller can produce a situation that isn't
possible to correct in the moment. Jamming in a marina largely can be
prevented by keeping a close eye on lines and stopping the prop if one
comes too close. However, monofilament fishing lines are effectively
invisible and some people have an annoying tendency to fish right in
channels.  Outside of a marina, trash, lobster and crab pots, and
free-floating discarded fishing lines can be a source of lines in the
water that can tangle the prop. Even in the open ocean there are
unfortunately cast loose fishing lines and net and trash.  A loose
propeller can be avoided with frequent inspections on one's own boat,
but is a hazard on a charter.

I've occasionally experienced halyards jamming with the sails raised
on small rental/charter keelboats, after sailing in strong wind. This
happened from either from the sheave breaking at the top or the
halyard jamming in the cleat at the bottom. I think those could have
been prevented by better inspection and maintenance, as well as sizing
the cleats, blocks, and halyards appropriately.

I've fortunately never had a halyard jam on boats that I maintained,
but I've learned to carry a rigging knife when on someone else's
keelboat. I'd rather apologize and pay for cutting their halyard than
for sinking their boat in a storm.

With proper care in well-known waters, serious grounding is extremely
rare. However, even with careful attention to charts and tide tables,
with enough sailing time it a question of _when_, and not _if_ a
grounding will happen--and whether it is a slightly embarrassing pause
on a sandbar, or a life threatening catastrophe with waves pounding
the hull into a rocky shore. 

I don't know anyone with significant sailing experience who hasn't
grounded at some point. How often grounding occurs depends on where
and how you sail. My own experiences have been largely with silted-in
channels at low tide and isolated submerged rocks in unfamiliar
waters. 

An apparently light grounding that one escapes can still cause a
serious propulsion problem if the propeller or shaft is damaged in the
process. They are protected by the keel in a head-on collision with an
underwater obstruction. However, they can be damaged if the boat
twists while it is grounded on rocks or a reef.

Systems
=========================================================================

Diesel Engine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most 30' and larger keelboats have an internal diesel engine or diesel
generator for either directly driving, or powering via batteries, the
auxilliary propulsion mechanism.

A diesel engine requires a functioning electrical system and power to
start or stop, but not to continue operating. So, one turns on the
engine's electrical system first, then starts the engine, and then
leaves the power on until after the engine is later stopped. In an
emergency, a diesel engine can also be stopped by manually depriving
it of fuel. A diesel engine will not start if it is below about 8
degrees C, so electric *glow plugs* can be used to heat it for a few
seconds when the ambient temperature is cold.

Marine diesel engines use seawater for cooling and will be damaged and
stopped if the cooling system fails. When turning on a marine diesel
engine, immediately listen for the cooling water emerging from the
boat.  If it is not, stop the engine and check the filters, stopcocks,
hoses, and water pump/impeller. The exhaust gas is mixed with the
expelled water, so there are relatively few fumes.

On boats without separate batteries for them, the other mooring
electrical systems may require the engine operating to have power. For
example, it is common for a bow thruster and anchor windlass to only
operate when the engine is running.


### Fuel

Unlike other fuels, diesel is not explosive at normal temperature and
pressure. For example, a match dropped into a bucket of diesel will be
extinuished instead of lighting. 

![ ](fueldock.jpg width=350px attrib="Departure Bay"
attrib-url="https://departure-bay-gas-n-go.business.site/") Marine
diesel (MDO) is naturally colored light yellow (which is called
"white") and can be hard to distinguish from dirty water. It is
visually indistinguishable from automobile diesel when undyed. MDO
may contain more heavy fuel oil and less bio-diesel than automobile
diesel. That is advantageous. It may have a higher sulphur content,
which is disadvantageous. However, both fuel products are intended to
power the same engines.

In some regions, marine diesel dyed red to distinguish it for tax
purposes. The red dye incidentally helps make spills and leaks more
visible. In the US and Canada, all marine and off-road vehicle diesel
is red and untaxed, unlike on-road automobile "white" diesel. In the
EU, lower-taxed red diesel is reserved for commercial vehicles. In UK
([2023, post Brexit](https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/white-diesel-is-it-worth-converting-from-red-79159)),
lower-taxed red diesel may be used by recreational
boaters. Recreational boat captains may need to have documentation on
where the fuel was purchased when entering a different region if using
red diesel, to show that it was taxed correctly where purchased.

Diesel will float on top of both fresh and salt water. This includes
in the fuel tank--water contamination and condensation will sink to
the bottom of the tank and must be pumped or siphoned from the bottom
instead of the top to remove it. Small amounts of water contamination also accumulate
in the bottom of the primary fuel filter and can be drained there.

![Diesel bug](dieselbug.jpg width=350px attrib="Yachting Monthly" attrib-url="https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/how-to-avoid-diesel-bug-32632")
*Diesel bug* is contamination by bacteria and algae within the fuel
tank.  It is exacerbated by the use of bio-diesel (which is pervasive
today to reduce fossil fuel production) and water in the tank.  It can
be mitigated by keeping the tank clean and nearly full, reducing the
volume available for oxygen and water vapor. Contaminated fuel can be
cleaned by filtering.

Marine and heavy equipment diesel engine service is measured in engine
hours, not distance as in an automobile. Because the engine is usually
run at a fixed speed that is most optimal, fuel consumption is correspondingly
measured in litres (or gallons) per hour. For example, the [Volvo Penta D2-55](https://www.volvopenta.com/marine/all-marine-engines/d2/) (Perkins 404)
engine consumes about 2L/hour in real world usage combining idling and
revving up to 2500 RPM.

The diesel fuel may also be used for a diesel heater. Modern heaters
are extremely efficient. For example, a
[Webasto heater](https://www.webasto-comfort.com/int/product-overview/#!Marine/Heating/Air_Heaters)
consumes about 0.3 L/hour.


### Starting Sequence

![Standard Yanmar engine start/stop/RPM panel](yanmarpanel.jpg width=350px attrib-url="https://www.yanmar.com/marine/product/panels/b20/")
In preparation, check the following before sailing:

1. Fuel level in the tank
2. Belt tension
3. Oil level and clarity with the dipstick
4. Pan under the engine for oil leaks
5. Water and fuel filters
6. Water intake stopcock (should be open)

Record the engine hours and fuel level in the log.

When starting the engine:

1. If at night, turn on the steaming light
2. Check the water for lines, animals, and swimmers
3. Put the drive in neutral gear and the throttle at idle. This is just the center/neutral position
   in a single-control system.
3. Turn on the electrical power to the engine. There should be a continuous alarm
   when it is on 
4. If it is very cold, hold the glow plug button for a few
   seconds. The amount of time depends on the engine and the
   temperature. Check for clear water again right before starting.
5. Press the engine start button
6. Verify that the cooling system is operating. You should hear water
   splashing from the exhaust port immediately in bursts. In a marina,
   you can usually see it over the side as well. Shut off the engine
   if water is not being expelled.

Leave the electrical power on while the engine is on. The power is
needed to shut it off again.


### Stopping Sequence

1. Ensure that you are firmly moored or have sufficient way under sail
   for steering
2. Lower the throttle to idle speed and put the engine in neutral
3. Press the engine stop button
4. Turn off the electrical power to the engine
5. If sailing at night, turn off the navigation steaming light
6. Put the drive in gear

The propeller will turn the shaft when the boat is sailing if the
drive is left in neutral. This can cause wear and damage the engine.
To prevent this, most systems require that the drive be left in gear
when the engine is off. This could be either forward or reverse gear
depending on 


Shaft Drive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The traditional drive system for a boat is a propeller *shaft*
directly in line with the engine and run out through the hull to a 
*propeller*. The *stuffing box* minimizes the water ingress where
the shaft penetrates the hull, but will *weep* small amounts of water
in normal operation.

![Shaft drive](shaft-drive.jpg width=350px attrib="BoatsNews.com" attrib-url="https://www.boatsnews.com/story/25131/shaft-line-for-sailboats-the-queen-of-propulsions")
The design of a shaft drive is typically constrained such that the
shaft is at a slight downward angle as it exits the hull. This means
that the propeller is not pointing straight backwards but instead
slightly downwards as well. This angle gives rise to *prop walk*,
where varying force exerted by the blades on the bottom and top
creates a lateral force on the stern of the boat. Prop walk is
advantageous for accelerating turns when in a marina, but reduces the
efficiency of motoring straight for long distances.


Mechanical Saildrive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

![[Volvo Penta D2 saildrive and engine](https://www.volvopenta.com/marine/leisure-boating/sailboat-solutions/saildrive/)](saildrive.png width=300px)
A saildrive is like the shaft and propeller of an outboard engine, but
mounted to the inboard engine. It connects to the back of the engine and
projects downward from the bottom of the hull.


Saildrives have several advantages over shaft drives, which has led
to their nearly universal application in new boats. Only a handful of
manufacturers use shaft drives today (such as Rustler and Island
Packet).

Saildrives create less vibration and noise underway. They are more
efficient than shaft drives when traveling straight for long
distances. They consume less internal volume, creating more room
for storage and accomodation. The seals do not weep and are less likely
to leak than a stuffing box, keeping the bilge drier.

There are also drawbacks of saildrives compared to shaft drives. They
require professional maintenance every 5-10 years. The enclosure is
made from aluminum, and requires sacrificial anodes and frequent
monitoring to avoid corrosion. 

![Saildrive projecting from hull](saildrive-exterior.jpg width=300px attrib="Yachting Monthly" attrib-url="https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/essential-saildrive-checks-for-your-boat-77913")
The relatively minimal prop walk in
reverse makes turning more difficult by precluding the back-and-fill
maneuver, perhaps requiring a bow thruster to compensate on longer
boats. The through-hull hole for a saildrive is very large compared to
a propellor shaft hole. It is sealed by a major gasket and has a
separate leak alarm.


Electric Saildrive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electric saildrives, such as [Oceanvolt Sail Drive](https://oceanvolt.com/solutions/systems/sail-drive/), are not mechanically coupled
to the engine. They instead use electric motors to power a saildrive.

This fully unconstrains the location of the generator, or allows
removing the generator entirely if an alternative source of power such
as solar and large batteries is available. While sailing, the
propeller can also be used for regeneration, creating a small amount
of drag and recharging the batteries.

Electric saildrives are nearly silent and allow operation with the
generator off. They provide power instantly and do not require the
careful spin up time of a mechanical drive to reach high amounts of
thrust. They also allow the generator to be run at its most efficient
RPMs independent of the speed of the propeller.

![Systems devoted to propulsion for an Oceanvolt SD installation](oceanvolt.jpg attrib="Oceanvolt" attrib-url="https://oceanvolt.com/solutions/systems/sail-drive/")

The primary downside of electric saildrives is that they are a bit
ahead of their time for most sailors. Their power requirements in turn
lead to the necessity of LiFePO4 batteries, which creates a complex
and relatively new system compared to the less expensive, proven, and
easy to repair/source parts for diesel engine and AGM batteries.

On monohulls, it is difficult to achieve sufficient power for
recharging without using diesel. A large catamaran has enough
coachroof and deck area to use solar. This means that monohulls with
electric saildrives are still using diesel generators (reducing many
of the electric advantages), required to recharge by shore power
frequently, or dominated by power conservation concerns when operated.

Two cruising YouTubers who use electric drives on monohulls are [Sailing
Uma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHUQiRyVV3Y) and [Sailing Oka Solo](https://www.youtube.com/@sailingokasolo6801). 
They demonstrate that it is possible to go fully electric if
one is willing to have power conservation be a dominant factor in daily
planning.


Propellers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A propeller's efficiency depends on the number of blades, their size,
and their angle of attack. Sailboat propellers usually fold when not
in use to reduce drag, which tends to restrict them to two or three
blades. Even rigid props typically have three blades to reduce their
drag under sail.

Propellers must be protected from galvanic corrosion by sacrificial
anodes. For salt water, these are made from zinc and so are often
called "zincs".

Propellers are vulnerable to catching loose lines in the water. High
risks are a boat's own docking lines and sheets, fishing lines, and
nets. Snagging a line can immediately disable a propeller. The
helmsperson should constantly check for loose lines and be paranoid
about lines falling in the water. A *linecutter* attachment on the end 
of the shaft is a circular set of blades that can sometimes protect
the propellor by shredding lines that are encountered moving from bow
to stern.

A recent [research design](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/other/doc/2023-02/TVO_Technology_Highlight_41_Toroidal_Propeller.pdf) for propellers eliminates the tip vortex drag
by using a toroidal shape that has no tips on the blades.
Unfortunately, this is not practical for a sailboat folding prop.

Thrusters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A *bow thruster* provides lateral force at the bow. It is typically a
propeller with an electric motor mounted in a tunnel at the bow. This
can be used for turning the boat while docking. Most modern boats over
40' use bow thrusters because their heavy mass makes them hard to turn
tightly.

![Bow thruster in tunnel](bowthruster.jpg width=350px)
A bow thruster can also drop down from a compartment in the bow. This
reduces drag under sail. The drawback is that it is more likely to
catch lines and seaweed, is a part that can fail, and there is more
delay to engaging the thruster.

Less common on sailboats are *stern thrusters*, which typically drop
down in the stern. Using both bow and stern thrusters enables translational
movement away from a dock on very large boats and can enhance the ability
to spin in place.

[*Jet thrusters*](https://www.jetthruster.com/) are like a jetski, and pump sea water through at high
speed to create thrust. The drawback of these is that they pump
seawater at high speed through the boat, which is a high risk if a
hose breaks loose. A typical bow thruster has only a very small
through-hull connection for the electrical wires and is otherwise
completely sealed outside the boat, eliminating the risk of leaks.
