                         **Motoring a Sailboat**
                            Updated 2023-03-25

Keelboats often have motors to aid in docking or make way in poor
sailing conditions. This article focuses on maneuvering 30' and larger
keelboats with internal engines. Engine maintenance and mooring
techniques are covered in spearate articles.

Also not covered in this article are keelboats under 30', which
usually have outboard motors.  These boats operate much like slightly
awkward motor launches under power and the techniques described here
are not necessary. That is, except for having to steer with both the
engine and tiller, they are relatively straightforward (once your
engine starts). In a pinch, shorter boats are also amenable to
paddling, sculling with the rudder, and being pushed or pulled by hand
off obstructions in a marina.

The key idea of motoring a keelboat is that the helmsperson must
manipulate several sources of force and momentum in concert to achieve
the desired motion.  Salboats under power do not drive like cars. They
don't even drive like busses, which are closer to the length and mass
involved. Putting the transmission in gear and steering wide turns
works for covering distance in open areas, but is not how to to
maneuver a boat within a marina.

The forces involved are the wind and current, the fore-aft thrust of
the propeller, the drag of the rudder, the prop wash redirection of
the rudder, the prop walk, and the linear and angular momentum of the
hull. These can be confusing and confounding factors when first
encountered, but become essential tools once understood. 

For example, it is a common situation to intentionally be in forward
gear and with the wheel steering to hard to starboard, while actually
moving backwards and rotating to port.

Sources of Thrust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The propeller is the main propulsive force under power until close
enough to the dock to leverage docking lines. Some boats also have
bow and/or stern thrusters.

Excepting thrusters, boats require water passing over the rudder to to
steer. Generally, one uses only enough power to have steerage and
maintain way against the current and wind _and no more_ when
maneuvering within a marina. For example, keeping speed low enough to
produce no wake and be able to stop quickly (less than 5 kts) when in
main fairway and extremely slow (1-2 kts) when in a secondary fairway
and actually docking.

The larger and heavier the boat, the longer it will take to respond
to direction changes between forward and reverse. While waiting
for the propeller to change the forward-aft movement, wind and current
continue to act on the boat. 

When in reverse, or forward in a boat with dual rudders, the rudder
acts in the direction that the boat is _actually_ going (its
velocity), not the direction that the thrust (acceleration) is
directed/way you _want_ to go.  So, if the boat is moving forward and
the helmsperson shifts into reverse, they must continue steering for
the foward direction until the motion stops and boat actually starts
moving in reverse. 

However, on a boat with a single rudder, even immediately after
shifting into forward there is prop wash over on the rudder which can
be directed as a sort of stern thruster.  This means that while
drifting backwards, the helmsperson can shift into forward with high
throttle to force the stern to slide laterally as if they were moving
forward, even though the boat is still moving backwards.

Older drive systems have separate gear shifts and throttle. Modern
controls tend to combine these into a single lever that automatically
shifts into gear with the throttle. With a separate shifter, it is
necessary to throttle down to low RPMs for a few seconds before
shifting in or out of gear to avoid damaging the drive system. A
single single lever system must be shifted into and held for a few
seconds before shifting into a different direction.

[Prop walk](https://ab-marine.com/knowledge-base/what-is-prop-walk) (asymmetric blade thrust)
: The phenomenon where a single propeller causes a slight sideways
  force on the stern
  because the upstroke
  side of the propeller cycle is slightly more effective than the
  downstroke. It is stronger in reverse, at high RPM, and with shaft
  drives. (Shaft drives are oriented slightly downward as they exits
  the boat, vs. saildrives that are oriented perfectly
  vertically). The direction depends on the orientation of the
  propeller. Most boats have right-handed propellers that walk to port
  in reverse and to starboard in forward gear. Depending on the
  vessel, prop walk can vary from effectively undetectible to so
  strong that a boat cannot turn in one direction to reverse.

[Prop wash](https://www.scotsail.co.uk/articles/effect_of_rudder_and_propwash.html)
: The flow of water off the propeller. In forward gear with a single
  rudder, the wash flows over the rudder and provides some steering
  capability even at low speed. In reverse or on a dual rudder boat,
  the wash does not flow over the rudder, so steering requires boat
  motion relative to the water current.

Thrusters
: Electrically powered propellers or jets that can apply brief lateral
  thrust while docking. Single bow thrusters are most common on
  sailboats, usually above 35 feet. Additional stern thrusters appear
  on even larger boats. A single thruster is useful for turning with a
  small radius. Two thrusters can allow turning in place as well as
  lateral movement without requiring a turn.

Fore and aft speed over ground stretches the radius when
turning. Reducing speed by shifting into neutral or reversing
direction to slow the boat as it turns will tighten the turning
radius. Likewise, turning while moving upwind is sharper than while
moving downwind. Of course, some way is required to maintain steerage.
So, if fore and after speed is eliminated to make the sharpest turn,
there is temporarily no steering control. 

It is possible to turn a boat nearly in its own length, which is
necessary when turning around within a narrow fairway. To do this, the
helm must exploit momentum and change directions while turning.  They
pull to the leeward side of the fairway, shift into neutral, and turn
the rudder hard to windward. As the boat turns, it will also get
closer to the windward boats. The helm then reverses thrust briefly,
while keeping the rudder over until the boat begins to move backwards.
At that point the helm throws the rudder the other way. The process
then repeats when the boat gets closer to the leeward side, although
more conservatively there, and continues alternating thrust and rudder
orientation while always maintaining the turn's momentum in the same
direction.

This is called a *three point turn*. In light wind it can be executed
without ever making way in reverse (although the thrust must still be
reversed to stop forward motion temporarily and tighten the turn).  In
heavy wind or a very narrow fairway, it may take many more than three
points to turn.

If the boat has prop walk, prefer to turn in the direction where prop
walk assists the turn. This is turning clockwise, to starboard for a
boat that walks to port in reverse. The turning maneuver is then
called a *back and fill* and can be exceptionally tight.


It is common on recent 35' and larger performance cruisers to have
twin rudders and a sail drive. This configuration is efficient for
motoring forwards long distances and sailing, but can be challenging
to maneuver in tight quarters. It has no prop wash, minimal prop walk,
and often the boat requires significant movement in reverse before
there is any steerage available. 

In my limited personal experience with this configuration, I've found
two strategies the best for moving in reverse. The first is to
initiate turns while moving forward. I use a brief reverse thrust
without changing the helm to halt the forward velocity while
maintaining the turn in place. If the rotation ends earlier than
needed, I give forward thrust without touching the helm. This is like
a back and fill, but does not gain the advantage of prop walk.

The second strategy is to turn the boat around long before reverse is
needed, and back into the side fairway or dock from that long distance.
This requires steering in reverse for longer, but ensures that the
boat has steerage when the critical backing occurs because it was
already in motion.



Fallback Plans
============================================================================

All aspects of sailing require multiple fallback plans and preparation
to enact them immediately in the event of an emergency or other change
of situation. A competent skipper is prepared to immediately take
action while sailing if the boat broaches, an obstruction is sighted,
or any equipment fails.

When motoring in open water, there is generally a lot of time to
respond to a propulsion failure. If in bad weather and the motor is
needed to maintain steerage relative to waves, there are several
natural fallbacks.  The first is (of course) sailing. If the
conditions or rig preclude sailing for some reason, raising the sails
and heaving to is the next option.  Towing warps or some sort of sea
anchor or drogue are 

When docking or picking up a mooring, it is important to assume that 
one might miss the intended landing point or line cast and have a plan
for how to abort the operation and try again.

It is also necessary to prepare to react to unexpected situations that
are beyond the ability of the crew to prevent, as described
below. While sailing, many external problems such as weather or
obstructions can often be recognized some time in advance, and even
equipment failures are frequently slow moving problems that give some
time to consider and react. During docking and marina maneuvers,
problems can arise with little warning or time to respond.

## Escapes

When operating under power, the skipper must constantly be prepared to
handle an engine or propeller failure, grounding, an unexpected
obstruction, or the wind or current having unanticipated strength. The
"unexpected obstruction" could be a rock or submerged piling. But it
is often a power boat or kayak emerging from behind a dock or
breakwater. Lacking masts, those small boats are hard to spot early.

You have several resources available when operating under power. In
the more common case of needing to make an evasive maneuver when the
propulsion system is operating well, stopping, backing, or turning are
the main options. Consider which you'd use before the need arises
and keep an eye on that "escape" route to ensure it is clear.

## Propulsion Failures

Powered propulsion can fail as well. Some likely causes are running
out of fuel (due to an incorrect gauge or the idiocy of not checking),
the prop being fouled, a loose propeller not rotating with the shaft,
or an engine failure such as fuel or cooling system clog or broken
pump. Gaining control over the vessel takes priority over restarting
the engine in this situation. Attempting to diagnose and repair the
cause of the failure in time to recover control under power is usually
not realistic.

If a channel or sufficiently wide fairway with favorable wind and a
few minutes before anything disastrous happens, raising at least the
mainsail and proceeding under sail is my preference. This means that
the mainsail should always be ready to be raised when under power near
shore. The halyard must be attached to the head of the sail, the
working end to run and on the winch, and no significant lashings
holding down the sail.

In a tight anchorage or fairway with other traffic, raising the jib
before the mainsail allows the helmsperson to have some forward way
and steerage to avoid immediate collisions. The jib is usually faster
to raise or unfurl than the mainsail. Once the collision is avoided,
the crew can then raise the mainsail. Beware that when operating under
jib alone there is a lot of force blowing the bow off the wind.  This
prevents sailing in a close hauled direction or tacking.

If powered propulsion is lost outside of a marina with a bit of sea
room, then another option is temporarily dropping anchor. This will
slow or stop the drift of the boat to buy more time to recover control
or radio for assistance. Anchoring is especially valuable when faced
with a lee shore, where a hastily raised sail may not give enough power
to claw back to safety. 

Note that dropping anchor on short notice can be tricky. Someone has
to get to the bow (although hopefully there was already a lookout
there), if the engine failed then a powered windlass won't work, and
there's no time to set it well, so the anchor will likely drag and may
skip when dropped.

Responding to the unexpected requires creativity and judgement. In the
right conditions, it might be possible to leverage current or
prevailing wind, or surf a boat in waves to gain steerage in the event
of a loss of motor propulsion. The tender could be deployed to tow the
big boat. Crew could attempt to lasso pilings with docklines to warp
to safety. The boom can be weighted and swung out to heel the boat and
free it when grounded. But these methods are all risky and dangerous
in the wrong conditions, so the skipper's experience and awareness all
come into play for judging the tradeoffs.

## Sail Failures

A less common failure mode for anchoring or mooring is when the sails
cannot be dropped. Some causes of this are a halyard jamming at the
masthead or inside of the mast, a headsail twisting around another
forestay or instrument, an overridden halyard winch, a jammed halyard
cleat, a sail being caught on a spreader, a furler overriding and
jamming, the main jamming with a broken slide in the track, a battened
main catching on a lazy jack, and a furling main overriding and
jamming inside of the boom or mast.

Depending on the sea and wind conditions, being stuck with a sail up
can vary from annoyance to serious danger. The amount of time to
resolve it and choice of methods will be dictated by the sea
conditions. A jammed furling headsail can be dropped using the halyard
if it is possible to completely unfurl it. A halyard that is jammed at
the bottom can be dropped by cutting the halyard (although--then you have a
catastrophic problem when you need to raise the sail). Often a lightly
jammed furling main or broken slide can be cleared by raising and redropping
under appropriate tension.

In an extreme case, it may be necessary to cut a jammed sail, which is
expensive and dangerous as the free parts flies about in the wind. Or,
it might even be necessary to send crew up the mast. That is extremely
dangerous in wind and waves with a sail unfurled. There aren't great
options in some of these situations.  Rely on careful inspection,
preventative maintenance, and raising and lowering sails with care to
avoid the problem happening in the first place.

## Judging the Risk

What are the actual chances of needing to execute on a fallback plan
under power or docking? Having to back out of a fairway or dodge an
unexpected vessel is a fairly common occurence in my
experience. Motoring in a marina is like driving a car in busy parking
lot, where you know that others will be backing out and pedestrians
will be dashing between cars all of the time. In this analogy, paddleboarders
and kayakers are the dashing "pedestrians" of a marina.

A lightly jammed headsail that can be freed by pulling it back out and
refurling is also fairly common, especially on a charter boat where
you don't maintain the furler and may not be familiar with its
idiosyncrasies.

How often a furling main jams seems to depend highly on the furling
system and the skipper. Sailor bars and online sailing forums are full
of debate on this point. Claims vary from considering mainsail furling
to be a death trap to insisting that the main can reliably be furled
in a storm.

A tragically timed engine stall is something that doesn't shock me on
an older boat or a smaller one with an outboard, but isn't an everyday
problem. If it is an everyday problem, then you need engine
maintenance! (Or should forget the thing exists and plan to dock
without it.) A well-maintained inboard engine that has just been
inspected, has clean fuel, and is navigating through sufficiently
clean water is not the most likely failure point when motoring through
a marina.

I've had a few halyards jam on small rental keelboats after sailing in
strong wind. This happened from either from the sheave breaking at the
top or the halyard jamming in the cleat at the bottom. I think those
could have been prevented by better inspection and maintenance, as
well as sizing the cleats, blocks, and halyards appropriately. I've
fortunately never had a halyard jam on boats that I maintained, but
I've learned to carry a rigging knife when on someone else's
keelboat. I'd rather apologize and pay for cutting the halyard than
for sinking the boat.

With proper care in well-known waters, serious grounding is extremely
rare. However, even with careful attention to charts and tide tables,
with enough sailing time it probably a question of _when_, and not
_if_ a grounding will happen--and whether it is a slightly
embarrassing pause on a sandbar or a life threatening catastrophe with
waves pounding against a rocky shore. I don't know anyone with
significant sailing experience who hasn't grounded at some point. How
often grounding occurs depends on where and how you sail. My own
experiences have been largely with silted-in channels at low tide and
isolated submerged rocks in unfamiliar waters.
