               **Advanced Dinghy Racing Tactics**
              Published 2023-05-29; Updated 2024-05-29

This article contains notes for dinghy racers who are comfortable with
their boat handling in all conditions and with the racing rules. It
focuses on advanced techniques for ILCA (Laser) style catboats
primarily in one-design or highly similar design races.

This article is a collection of notes from my coaches and online
videos for techniques I'm working on myself. So, it is less polished
and more frequently updated than other articles.

I find that upwind legs in waves are the most physically demanding
part of dinghy racing and downwind leags are the most mentally
demanding. Upwind you're making minor course adjustments and deciding
when to tack, but are hiked out hard and constantly shifting weight
and steering aggressively on waves. For downwind, the body position is
_relatively_ less exhausting, but there are many viable courses and
many factors to balance, such as wave sets, lanes from behind, puffs,
nuanced sail trim, when to gybe, and gate mark choice. A long reach is
rare to find on most courses but fun, uncomplicated speed in
comparison to upwind and downwind.


Lanes
===================================================

Your "lane" is the space from your sail pointing upwind and tilted
slightly in the direction of your boat's present motion. That's where
your wind comes from. You need that lane to be empty so that you have
undisturbed wind.

Note that the angle changes slightly as you change speed.

At the start, you are maneuvering to begin with an open lane. You then
want to maintain it as much as possible. Upwind, the leaders have the
most control over lanes and are defending them. Downwind, they are
vulnerable after the rest of the fleet has cleared the mark and is
intentionally blocking their lanes to close the gap.

If you don't have a clear lane within five boat lengths of the start
it is time to tack out of the position and get away from the fleet.
As the fleet progresses to the left side of the course on starboard
your position will rapidly degrade. Tacking away late means that you
get caught between the closed lanes of the starboard fleet as well as
the closed lanes of the early-exit port fleet.


Upwind
===================================================

Small waves (period shorter than the boat):
- Use upper body movement and aggressive tiller movement on waves to keep the bow attached to the water but not plunging in
- Try to steer for the flat water between wave sets
- "High mode" in flat water: pinch up, weight forward, sheet in all of the way hike hard to keep the boat flat
- "Low mode" to punch through waves: fall off a few degrees, weight middle/back, ease the sail, allow a small amount of leeward heel. 
  You may hear the phrase "bow down" in this context--it refers to down off the wind, not vertically down digging into the water.

Big waves (period longer than the boat):

- Diagonal up wave: Bear off the wind up the wave, weight back to lift bow and increase speed
- Straight down wave: Head up when riding the wave, weight forward to stay connected and pinch


Gusts: ease, hike, trim

Lulls: move weight in, coast forward

Keep knees together and always be in a position where you can shift
your weight in/out as well as fore/aft. In light wind this is jammed
against the front of the cockpit and slid in relatively far, sitting
on the gunnel or inside it. In heavy wind this means moving
progressively further back and hiking more.

Weight forward digs the bow in and lifts the stern. This helps with
pointing. Weight more backward lifts the bow and helps with speed.
Note that fore/aft changes with wind strength. The mast will force
the bow into the water by itself in heavier air, so your body must
move back to compensate for that.

As you make fore/aft weight adjustments, pay attention to in-out as
well. The flow over the daggerboard should always be uninterrupted
and it should remain close to vertical. Upwind the daggerboard flow
is as or more important than sail flow.

Upwind in a dinghy, the vang and cunningham should always have a
little tension. In heavy air they should have a lot of tension to
depower the sail. The outhaul is about the same in all normal
conditions with a hand-width of space between the sail and the
boom. In survival conditions flatten closer than that using the
outhaul.

As the wind builds, depower with cunningham, then vang, then outhaul,
then daggerboard, then mainsheet (luff). Cunningham can pull the tack
of the sail all of the way down to the boom, much further than you
might expect.  When you do this, the sail will show creases at clew.
The lower batten will invert when fully flattened. This is from
the cunningham and not from the outhaul.

![Roll tacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF2eK6sCOrI)

If you end up above the layline due to wind shifts or a misjudged
tack, do not sail all of the way to the mark on a close reach. That is
fast but creates an opening for leeward boats.  Instead, sail down to
the layline and then head up right on it.  This forces other boats to
come at your stern. They then have to go below the layline to pass,
putting them in a bad position, or to try and pass to windward where
you can head them up.


By the Lee
===================================================

## Rounding
When rounding from close hauled to by the lee (windward-leeward course),

1. Ease the vang halfway
2. Release the outhaul
3. *Round the mark*, simultaneously
 - Easing the mainsheet to keep the sail trimmed
 - Heel the boat to windward
4. Move weight forward to the squatting position in the cockpit
5. Release the cunningham entirely
6. Raise the daggerboard in an ILCA (not in an RS Aero)
6. Adjust the vang as needed, probably easing it more


## Sailing

By the lee has reverse flow. You're essentially reaching "on the wrong
side", with the wind running backwards from leech to luff. In moderate
breeze, the masthead wind indicator should point to the leeward side
and the telltales will hang down or reverse. The sail may look like it
is luffing in light air between puffs.

Keep the kicker loose so that the leech can move forward with a high
degree of twist. An expert sailor in a ILCA 7 or RS Aero might let it
almost completely off.

For an ILCA 6 sail (which is wide and short) or a less confident
sailor with a large rig, don't ease the kicker too much. In that case
the boom will ride up in gusts and lose power, and you also risk a
deathroll if you can't shift weight to windward and trim in fast
enough.

Look at the leech position, not the boom position; the boom might be
at 70 degrees in heavy air but the leech at the top will have pushed
past 90 degrees. Trim the most twisted point on the leech, about
3/4 of the way to the top. In light wind, the boom will be close to 90
degrees or maybe slightly past 90.

Take on windward heel. Steer primarily with weight and sails, not
rudder. Use the tiller to feel where the boat wants to go in the
current trim rather than directing it.

Move weight forward when heeling the boat as the bow digging in will
emphasize the turn.

Shift weight aft, making the rudder dig in and removing the bow dig if
there's too much weather helm in heavy wind

Accelerating while surfing or in a gust by the lee shifts the apparent
wind forward and decreases it. When this happens, trim in, turn towards
to dead downwind, and move weight over the daggerboard.

In waves, make S-turns for legal acceleration and then surf down
waves.  Steer to catch waves, glancing backwards if the waves are
moving faster than the boat. Use deep reaches and by the lee in
combination to reach the waves, hit the layline, or maneuver relative
to puffs and other boats.


## Light Wind Trim

Head the boat slightly past dead downwind, easing the
sail and vang to maintain speed. Sheet directly from the boom,
with the mainsheet close to its maximum length.
Squat at the forward edge of the
cockpit on the windward side and reverse heel to reach this
point. 

When at the desired heading, accentuate the heel so
that the sail rocks up into stronger air and the boat holds itself on
course. Feel for tension in the main. When there is little tension in the sheet,
increase the windward heel and ease the sail. As tension builds, shift weight
in, head "up" towards dead downwind, and sheet in as the boat
accelerates. 

When the puff passes, reverse these, heeling to windward and bearing away
from dead downwind back towards the lee.

Gybing in light wind requires pulling the sail across hard and then
heeling on the new windward side to reach the new heading. Some ILCA
sailors grab the main at the traveler behind them and pull it across.
Others flick the main from the boom or behind the block. 
In the RS Aero, grab the main from the boom and throw it from there.

Reach
===================================================

## Rounding

When rounding a mark and bearing off from close hauled onto a reach
(trapezoid or triangle course):

2. Ease the outhaul
3. Ease the vang _only a little_
4. *Round the mark*
5. Move weight aft
6. *Wait* for acceleration
7. Release the cunningham
8. Ease the main to the new course
9. Adjust the vang for the new course

Do not ease the sail substantially until already moving fast on the
new course.  Easing too early is slow if it causes drag or breaks
flow.


## Sailing

When properly trimmed on a broad reach:

- Weight aft
- Boom around 60-70 degrees
- Leech a little less than 90 degrees
- Cunningham off
- Outhaul relatively loose
- Kicker eased compared to upwind vang sheeting. The boom should be
  riding up a little, but do not let the leech spill uncontrollably or
  shift too far forward.


## Deathroll

The deathroll is a dinghy capsize to windward from a broad reach:

![Laser Deathrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0RbhyMd3kA&t=28s)

It occurs when the mainsail is too far out for the heading. This often
occurs because the sailor has eased the mainsheet and vang too much
after rounding a windward/offset mark.

Do not let the leech get further than 90 degrees from the heading.
That is, do not let the leech get ahead of the mast. Recall that the
vang and main are the controls that affect the leech.

When you feel a deathroll begin:
 1. Shift weight aggressively to leeward to keep the boat flat
 2. Bear off and sail by the lee with the same trim _or_ sheet and vang in appropriately for your course

Do not follow your upwind intuition to head up or ease the sail!
On a broad reach, these will stall the rudder, make the sail position worse, and
accelerate the capsize. Explanations:

Racing Marks
===================================================

Enter wide, exit tight to shut out competitors and hit new heading cleanly.

For a downwind mark, prefer to gybe on approach instead of gybing
around the mark.

As you approach the zone, talk to other boats early. That way everyone
knows who is taking which side at a gate and who has room rather than
shouting at the last minute.




Physical
===================================================

For all day regattas in moderate heat, every hour I need to consume about 100
calories of sugar and about half a litre of water, with some
electrolytes. Watered down
[Gatorade](https://www.verywellfit.com/is-gatorade-good-or-bad-for-you-4177592#toc-usefulness-as-a-sports-drink)
is a convenient way to combine these. I carry one bottle of this and
one bottle of pure water. Having two bottles also means that if one
is lost or gets salt water in it then I have a backup. I also keep two Clif
bars or similar in my dry bag for lunch if I don't have a support
boat.

I dress to minimize UV skin exposure and err on the side of slightly
warmer. When too hot, I get wet and let evaporative cooling from the
surrounding water instead of my own sweat cool me off. When it is
really hot (above 30C) and the water is relatively clean, I might even
stay in the water between races holding on to the side of my boat.

Wearing a separate neoprene top and spray coat on a farmer john
instead of a full wetsuit allows adjusting layers as temperature,
wind, and spray change throughout the day. Changing between races can
be a little tense if they have short start sequences and are packed
closely.
