                  **Sailboat Racing Handicaps**
                 Published 2023-06-29; Updated 2023-08-13

<script src="handicap.js"></script>

The two autocalibrating handicap systems for mixed class racing are
the
[Portsmouth Yardstick](https://www.rya.org.uk/racing/technical/handicap-systems/portsmouth-yardstick)
for dinghies, and
[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet](https://www.ussailing.org/competition/offshore/phrf/)
(PHRF) for larger keelboats. Both of these are based on observed
previous performance of boats and updated frequently. This article
gives the equations needed for scoring races with them.

In each system, the Elapsed Time (_ET_) of a boat is the measured time
at which they finish relative to their start, and the Corrected Time
(_CT_) is the computed value based on their handicap that is used for
determining ranking. 

The [Offshore Racing Congress Rule](https://orc.org/organization)
(ORCR) is a measurement based rule for fairly large sailboats and
longer offshore races. I do not discuss it here.

Previous handicap systems such as IOR, IMS, and US DPN are now obsolete.

Conversion
========================================================================

The approximate conversions between PHRF, RYA Portsmouth Numbers, and
US Dixie Portsmouth Numbers are below. The DPN to PN conversion is
based on fitting a line to the handicaps for the same boats under the
different systems, and could vary slightly depending on the year in
which it is computed. 

\begin{eqnarray}
PHRF &=& 6 \times DPN - 330 \\
DPN &=& \tfrac{1}{6} \times PHRF + 55 \\
PN &=& \tfrac{100}{6} \times DPN - 462 \\
PN &=& \tfrac{100}{36} \times  PHRF - 1378 \\
PHRF &=& \tfrac{36}{100} \times  PN + 496
\end{eqnarray}

PHRF
========================================================================

The PHRF handicap has units of seconds per nautical mile [s / NM]. A
fast boat has a low or negative rating. A slow boat has a high,
positive rating.

The difference between two boats' PHRF ratings is the expected
difference in their sailing times per mile.

PHRFs happen to be calibrated such that almost all boats have a lower
corrected time _CT_ than elapsed time _ET_. That is, PHRF makes most
boats virtually faster and is an advantage-based system.

For reference, here are some PHRFs for common boats. Note that these
values are adjusted for different styles of racing, rigs, crew weight,
etc. on specific boats.

There are two ways of applying PHRF. The race committee will choose
one.  These are Time-on-Distance, typically used for courses with a
known length and average wind conditions, and Time-on-Time for other
cases.

Time-on-Distance (TOD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{equation}
CT = ET - \dfrac{PHRF}{L}
\end{equation}

Where $L$ is the length of the course in nautical miles. 


Time-on-Time (TOT)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{equation}
CT = ET \times \dfrac{k}{k - M + PHRF}
\end{equation}

Where $M$ is the mean (average) $PHRF$ over all boats in the fleet and $k$
is a regionally varying constant that is usually between 550 and 650.


Portsmouth
========================================================================

The Portsmouth Number $PN$ is a unitless quantity in the RYA
Portsmouth Yardstick system. It is adjusted regionally each year based
on collected performance across clubs, and then per club in some
cases.  See [single-handed](../dinghies/dinghy1.md.html) and
[double-handed](../dinghies/dinghy2.md.html) dinghy handicap tables in
the respective articles.

PNs happen to be calibrated such that almost all boats have a higher
corrected time _CT_ than elapsed time _ET_. That is, PN makes most
boats virtually slower and is a disadvantage-based system.

Popular midrange performance dinghies including 420, ILCA 7 (Laser),
Wayfarer, GP14, Hadron H2, RS200, RS Aero 7, and the Europe are all
relatively close to each other around $PN = 1100$. Lower $PN$ numbers
are faster boats, higher numbers are slower boats.

Corrected Time
---------------------------------------------------------------

The corrected time _CT_ for a boat with elapsed time _ET_ and
Portsmouth number _PN_ is given by:

\begin{equation}
CT = ET \times \dfrac{1000}{PN}
\end{equation}


Lead Times
------------------------------------------------------------------
How much time do you need to beat another boat by to rank higher
than it?

A faster boat A ranks higher in the race than a slower boat B
if B finishes more than

\begin{equation}
\Delta T > ET_A \left(\dfrac{PN_B}{PN_A} - 1\right)
\end{equation}

seconds later. Conversely, boat B ranks higher if it finishes
less than $\Delta T$ seconds later.

For example, in a race that a Laser 7 finishes in 
$ET$ = 20 minutes, these boats need to finish by the following
elapsed times to tie it:

Boat     | PN   | Adjustment | ET To Tie
---------|-----:|-----------:|----------:
RS Zest  | 1260 |  -173 s    | 22:53
I420     | 1111 |  -11 s     | 20:11
Laser 7  | 1101 |  +0 s      | 20:00
Wayfarer | 1101 |  +0 s      | 20:00
Laser Vago|1064 |  +40 s     | 20:43
RS Aero 9| 1010 |  +99 s     | 18:21
29er     |  922 |  +195 s    | 16:45
RS 800   |  799 |  +329 s    | 14:30

Pursuit Offsets
----------------------------------------------------------------
In a pursuit race, the start times for each class are offset
so that all boats should finish at the same time. This means
that the rankings are based finish order and no correction
is needed after the race.

Let $PN_Z$ be the Portsmouth number of the slowest, "scratch" boat
class and $ET_Z$ be the anticipated elapsed time for
a boat in that class on the course. The offset start time
for another class is:

\begin{equation}
\Delta T = ET_Z \times \left(1 - \dfrac{PN}{PN_Z}\right)
\end{equation}

For example, in a pursuit race that an RS Zest will start at 14:30 (2:30 PM) and
is expected to complete in 1.5 hours, the start times for the other
boats should be:

<script>
{
let s = `
Class    | PN   | Start Adjustment | (m:s) | Start Time
---------|-----:|-----------:|--------:|----------:
`;

// Sort by handicap
const boatarray = Object.keys(Portsmouth.handicap);
boatarray.sort(function (A, B) {
    return Portsmouth.handicap[B] - Portsmouth.handicap[A];
});

const ET_Z = 1.5 * secondsPerHour;
const PN_Z = Portsmouth.handicap['RS Zest'];

for (const boat of boatarray) {
    const PN = Portsmouth.handicap[boat];
    const deltaT = ET_Z * (1 - PN / PN_Z);
    const startT = deltaT + 14.5 * secondsPerHour;
    s += `${boat} | ${PN} | ${formatTime(deltaT, 'delta s')} | ${formatTime(deltaT, 'delta m:ss')} | ${formatTime(startT, 'h:mm:ss')} \n`;
}

document.write(s);
}
</script>

This should match your intuition. The RS 800 $PN=799$ is about 2/3 of the RS Zest $PN=1260$,
so the RS 800's expected elapsed time is about 2/3 as much as the Zest and it starts
about 30 minutes later for a 90 minute race.


#### Derivation

For the derivation, I shorten the standard notation to $C = CT, E = ET, P = PN$
and leave out the multiplication signs.

The corrected times for the scratch boat $Z$ and another, faster boat
are given by:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:CZ} C_Z &=& E_Z \dfrac{1000}{P_Z} \\
C &=& E \dfrac{1000}{P} \\
\end{eqnarray}

Our goal is for all boats to finish at the same wall clock time of day
with staggered starts. That means for each boat

\begin{equation}
E + \Delta T = E_Z
\end{equation}

The elapsed time $E_Z$ of the scratch boat is fixed. We need to find
the $\Delta T$ such that on corrected time, $C_Z = C$ and all boats
would tie. Rearranging to expose the key variables gives:

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta T &=& E_Z - E \\
E &=& C \dfrac{P}{1000} \\
E_Z &=& C_Z \dfrac{P_Z}{1000} \\
C &=& C_Z
\end{eqnarray}

Substituting and simplifying provides the solution:

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta T &=& C_Z \dfrac{P_Z}{1000} - C_Z \dfrac{P}{1000}\\
\Delta T &=& C_Z \dfrac{P_Z - P}{1000}
\end{eqnarray}

We need this in terms of the actual elapsed time of the scratch boat, $E_Z$,
so substitute that from equation \ref{eqn:CZ}:

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta T &=& E_Z \dfrac{1000}{P_Z}  \dfrac{P_Z - P}{1000}\\
\Delta T &=& E_Z \dfrac{P_Z - P}{P_Z}\\
\Delta T &=& E_Z \left(1 - \dfrac{P}{P_Z}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
