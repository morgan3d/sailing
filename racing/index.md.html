![The comaraderie and exciting competition of racing, here in<br>a Laser (ILCA) single-handed competition.](laser-teaser.jpg width=540 attriburl="https://www.laserinternational.org/" attrib="ILCA")
The joke definition of a race is "any two sailboats on the same body
of water," and it true enough--most sailors are motivated to trim
their sails and squeeze out another knot of boat speed when another
boat appears. That core instinct taken to the next level has given us formal sailboat racing.

Racing has many variations that are described in the Race Types section.
However, whether sailed in professional national boats or
motley club sailors on a Wednesday night, all sailboat races are
governed by the
[racing rules of sailing](https://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/racing-rules-of-sailing/)
produced by World Sailing. These rules are revised every two years,
and modified for particular boat classes and events. National
variations are also published, for example US Sailing and Sail Canada
produce their own specializations. 

In this article I focus on the basic rules (which seldom change) and
their application for recreational racing. That case is both what most
sailors experience first and also the basis for varsity, national,
world class, and Olympic competition.

Your First Races
=========================================================================

Here's a brief guide to how to get started with racing. Keep your
expecations low for performance on your first few races and focus on
getting comfortable with the process and meeting the other
sailors. This section is intentionally oversimplified and covers the
most common case and general rules of thumb.

Step by Step
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<ol>
 <li>
   *Before the race, ensure that your boat is in good condition and
   ready to sail.* 
   
   Check all safety system and equipment. That includes
   PFDs, sunscreen, and drinking water. Then brief your crew and make ready to sail but do not raise the sail or cast off. For one-design races
   that are between identical boats, ensure that your boat is class legal.
 </li>
 <li>
   *Attend the skipper's meeting* on shore before the race to register,
   learn any special rules that the race committee is setting, and
   what the course is. You'll probably need to know:

   - Handicap PHRF, Portsmouth number, or DPN if all boats are not of the same design
   - Length of your boat
   - Name and sail number of your boat
   - Number of people on your boat who are racing

   For some casual series, there is no meeting and you check in with
   the committee boat on the water.
 </li>
 <li> 
   *Sail around near the start line and stay behind it. That is downwind of the line.*
   
   The start line is usually between an anchored *race
   committee boat* and a floating anchored ball called the *pin mark*.  The
   boat is at the starboard end of the line when you are facing
   towards the course and the pin is at the port end.
 </li>
 <li>
   *Observe the starting sequence and use it to time your start.*
   The race starting sequence is as follows:
  
   - Rapid sequence of sound signals blown to get everyone's attention (beep beep beep beep...)
   - -5 Minutes: Flag raised and one sound signal. The flag is authoritative and the sound is a courtesy.
   - -4 Minutes: Second flag raised and one sound signal.
   - -1 Minutes: Second flag lowered and one sound signal.
   - -0 Minutes: First flag lowered and one sound signal, usually long.
   
   For your first races, try to cross the line shortly after the
   start signal and on starboard tack. Try to be near the middle of the
   line so that you don't have to worry about being squeezed out or
   figuring out which side is favored.
   
   If there is a bad start and a recall (that is, a do-over), then the
   committee will immediately repeat the entire process, beginning
   with a large number of sound signals.
   
   
!!! Warning Starting Penalty (Rule 30)
   If you crossed the line too early, the committee will make a sound
   signal, raise a flag, and announce your boat name or number. If
   this happens, just stay out of everyone's way. Cross back so that your
   hull is completely on the pre-start side of the line, and then
   start again. Unless a specific penalty flag is raised, you do not
   have to circle around the pin or committee boat.
</li>
<li>
   *Go around the marks (anchored floats) of the course, taking them
   all on your port side. Do not hit the marks or other boats.*
   
   Do not use artificial propulsion such as a motor, paddle, rocking your
   boat, or sculling with your rudder. Beware that there are complex
   right of way rules at the mark that you do not yet know and
   conservatively give everyone lots of room.
   
   
!!! Warning Rule 31 and Part 2 Penalties
   If you are in a dinghy someone says "protest" or that you "fouled them" (Part 2 penalties), then stay 
   clear of other boats and take a *two-turn penalty*: tack, immediately gybe, tack again, gybe again, and then continue sailing in the original
   direction. If you only hit a mark (rule 31), take a *one-turn* penalty instead.
</li>
<li> 
   *Keep sailing until you cross the finish line*.
   
   You finish when any part of the *hull* crosses the line. The
   committee will make a sound signal when you cross. After finishing,
   stay clear of other boats that are still racing. If there are a
   series of races planned and you are really far behind (not just
   last place, but 10 minutes behind the second to last boat),
   consider *abandoning* that race to get set up in time for the next
   one and skip the last marks.
</li>
</ol>


Scores
---------------------------------------------------------------

Finish ranks (scores) are determined by the time at which boats
crossed the finish line. If all boats are the same type then this is
generally the order in which they finished.

If the boats are different from each other, then their measured
*course times (CT)* will be modified based on their handicaps to
produce *adjusted times (AT)* on which the boats are ranked. In some
cases, time penalties and compensation will be assigned based on rule
infractions.

The results will be posted after the race with corrected times. Note
that finishing on corrected time ahead of another boat is all that
matters; how much a boat was ahead by and its absolute time to
complete the course do not affect ranking.

Sportspersonship
-------------------------------------------

Before the committee meeting, introduce yourself to other skippers and
don't be shy about sharing that you are new to racing. They will
probably give you good advice! They will also likely try to avoid you
on the water if practical, to give you a little more room to learn the
sport without pressure.

If may initially appear that more experienced sailors are hostile
towards you on the water. For example, shouting requests and commands
at you from another boat (which is "*hailing*" and in some cases is
mandated by the rules), or sailing on near-collision courses. That's
the nature of racing and not anger directed at you. It only seems
aggressive and personal at first because you don't yet appreciate the
rules and strategy governing that situation and stumbled into their
way. Think of what the experience might be for someone stepping into a
competitive football or basketball game for the first time.

Boats sail very close to each other in races compared to recreational
sailing. They are intended to use right of way rules and create
near-collision situations to gain advantage. Simply give everyone else
room early in your career as you figure things out. You'll quickly
learn the rules and how to sail in the pack safely and in a
sporting manner.

As you begin to learn the rules, always focus first on being a good
competitor and colleague to everyone around you: your crew, the other
sailors, the committee, and the support workers. Improving as a sailor
is your second priority. Winning is a distant third priority.

Bring lunch for your crew, treat them with patience and respect on the
water, and thank them after the race. _Especially_ if they are your
family.

Until you are in the position where you are frequently battling for
first, second, or third, just follow the rules to avoid collisions. Do
not aggressively use rules to disadvantage other boats. There is no
point in battling for a low place and making both you and the other
boat slow and frustrated. Sail fast and focus on catching up to the
leaders.

By the time that you're experienced enough to be battling for a top
finish, you'll have learned the etiquite and situations in which it is
worthwhile to leverage technicalities and intentionally attack other
boats. In the mean time, focus on learning and being the person everyone 
wants to sail with.


Safety First
=========================================================================

Something I greatly admire about sailboat racing as a sport are the first
three rules, which focus solely on safety:

- Must render any assistance to other vessels in distress (1.1)
- A boat decides for itself whether to race and continue racing (3)
- Avoiding an imminent collision superceeds all other rules governing
  right of way (imminent can be highly subjective beforehand, but if a
  boat _could_ have avoided a collision that occurs, it is deemed at
  fault in assessing penalties)

Included in the rules for individual races are further safety rules,
including those governing PFD use, radios and transponders, life rafts,
and other emergency equipment.


The Course
=========================================================================

Penalties
=========================================================================


Elements of Racing
=========================================================================

Sailboat day racing combines multiple elements:

- Condition of the boat, through pre-race maintenance and rigging
  modifications within class rules.
- Strategy with regard to the overall path sailed, weather, and current.
- Tactics for managing interactions with nearby competitors by
  exploiting the rules.
- Crew teamwork and communication.
- Physical ability and technical skill in trimming and boat handling.

Note that raw sailing ability is only one of the elements! While
sailing ability is of course important, in many cases it is the least
significant factor in racing success. When every crew in a race has a
reasonable degree of individual boat-handling and crew teamwork, the
other factors can dominate. A good strategist in a well-maintained
boat might handily best a crew with more athletic prowess.



Right of Way
=========================================================================

International navigation rules (COLREGS) for when two boats meet
specify a *give-way* vessel and a *stand-on* vessel. Boats that are
racing are required to follow those rules with regard to non-racing
vessels, but are governed by modified rules with respect to each
other. 

When two boats meet in a race, one is the *give-way* vessel and the
other is the *right-of-way* vessel. Unlike in normal navigation, 
the boat with the right of way is not
required to stand on and maintain its current course and speed.  In
fact, it may and often will move in a manner that forces the give-way
vessel to make further course changes to avoid a collision.

The *give-way* vessel is required to *stay clear* and avoiding a
collision. However, the distance is generally _much_ less than in
normal navigation, where a give-way vessel must make obvious course
corrections and usually provides several boat lengths of space to the
the stand-on vessel. It varies with the size and speed of the boats
and the sea conditions.  It is not unusual for Laser racers to be only
tens of centimeters apart, or keelboats to pass within a few meters of
each other.

- Avoid collisions
- Starboard over port. When sailing downwind, the tack that the boat
  is on is determined by the side opposite the boom.
- Leeward over windward. This means that the boat on the other side
  of your sail has right of way over you.
- A boat being overtaken has right of way over the overtaking boat;
  the boat ahead of you has right of way.

Gaining right of way is not instantaneous. When a boat gains right of
way through its own actions, it is required to stay clear of the boat
it gained rights on until that boat has room to maneuver (2.13, 2.15,
2.16).

For example, consider the case of a port tack boat that approaches a
starboard tack boat and then tacks below it. The boat that just tacked
has right of way because it is to leeward and both are on starboard
tack. However, it must give the other boat some time to adjust course
to avoid a collision if their paths intersect (2.13).

TODO: becalmed/head to wind?

These are modified in certain situations:

- Zone around the mark
- Boat performing penalty circles or re-starting
- Room at obstructions
  - Committee boat is not an obstruction!
- Capsized boat is an obstruction


Simplified Rules Summary
=========================================================================

This section gives a simplified summary in relatively plain language
of the most critical and common rules. This is as an introduction and
memory aid. Racers must also read the full rules. The specific
definitions, rules, and subrules add significant detail and describe
subtleties not encapsulated here.

Definitions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Racers must *hail* (shout at) each other in certain circumstances, and
generally communicate more between boats than in recreational
sailing. The hails are to notify others of intentions to avoid
collisions ("I'm about to tack") in tight quarters, request or confirm
entitled space for navigation ("I need room at the mark"), and protest
each other's actions ("you just fouled me by not staying clear during
your tack under rule 2.13").


Mark. Fetching. Rounding. Leave to port by default. Cannot touch. Gate

Zone

Obstruction. A mark is not an obstruction.

Start

Finish. Do not need to cross the line completely!

Course
Leg

Proper course. 



Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Give all help to a person or vessel in danger (1.1)
- Port tack stay clear of starboard (10)
- Leeward stay clear of windward (11)
- Astern stay clear of ahead (12)
- Avoid collisions (14)
- Proper course (17): When _upwind on the same tack_, the
  leeward boat can't force a give-way competitor to pinch, 
  tack, or round the mark wide just to slow them down.
- Mark-Room (18):
  - Scope (18.1): Mark-room applies to boats _approaching_ a mark,
    upwind on the _same tack_, that will _both_ round without tacking, 
    or downwind on any tacks, when at least one of them is in the zone
  - Overlap (18.2):
     - If two boats are overlapped
       when the first reaches the zone, the outside boat
       must give the inside boat room to round the mark even if the overlap
       is later broken.
     - If not overlapped when reaching the zone, the astern
       boat must give room to the ahead boat even if an overlap is later
       established.
  - Tacking (18.3): A boat that tacks inside of the zone can't force a
    windward boat above close hauled and must give room to all inside
    overlapped boats. Tacking also causes a boat to lose its
    rights based on overlap (18.2.d).
    This typically only applies to tacking onto starboard and
    becoming the leeward boat, since the other cases are already covered by 
    non-mark rounding rules.
  - Gybe mark (18.4): An inside and overlapped boat must gybe promptly 
    after a (non-gate) gybe mark so as to not force give-way competitors
    to sail wide
- Obstruction (19): Generally give room at an an obstruction as if
  it was a mark. 
- Room to tack at an obstruction (20):  
  - If you need to tack to avoid a boat on the same tack,
    must hail. The other boat then either tacks itself
    or says "you tack" and gives room.
- Keep clear when taking a penalty (21)
- When not racing, keep clear of boats that are (23),
  for example, after finishing get out of the way
  of the other boats and before the start stay away
  from other races.
- Marks only affect the current leg being sailed (28)
  and can otherwise be ignored.




Study the official text of rule 18 carefully. It is complicated and is the
rule that most commonly affects critical situations.


Race Types
=========================================================================

The diversity of sailboat races includes:

- College varsity dinghies, typically 20 minutes with ten to forty 
  single- or double-handed boats
- Offshore races, which are typically multi-day and on large keelboats.
  Fatigue is a major factor.
- America's Cup, which today is a set of match races between
  design-rule boats fielded by countries
- SailGP, similar to formula one car racing for foiling catamarans
- Cross-ocean or around the world races, where weather forecasting,
  navigation, maintenance underway, and endurance are core parts of
  the challenge. Some of these races take months to complete!

Races are categorized as:

- *One-design* races in production boats, where all boats are
  identical.
- *Mixed-class* club races, here Portsmouth (dinghy) and PHRF
  (keelboat) handicaps are applied for fairness by adjusting the
  *time* sailed. Sometimes the time is preadjusted based on the length
  of the course and start times are staggered, so that the first boat
  to finish will win.
- *Design-rule* races in custom boats, where an equation for boat
  metrics and set of training rules gives creative design freedom
  while governing overall fairness.

Because the absolute time does not matter in most scoring, sailing
_fast_ is not as important as sailing _faster_ than the
competition. This means that a large part of strategy in a sailboat
race is creating situations in which the rules favor one's own
boat and prevent competitors from gaining ground or passing.

Some scoring variations beyond first-across-the line can create more
complex strategic goals:

- *Handicap* races are won based on *adjusted time* (AT) instead of
  *course time* (CT) finishes. A fast boat that will have to "give time"
  needs to avoid battling individual other fast competitors. Instead,
  it must focus on minimizing its time relative to slower boats that
  are not being thwarted.
- *Match* races have only two boats facing off head-to-head.
- *Team racing* is scored by the finish positions of a set of boats
  that sail together as a team. Instead of individually sailing to
  finish first, they collaborate to slow competitors and ensure that
  their fleet's set of finish positions is collectively higher than
  their opponents'.
- A *regatta* is a set of races in which the winner has the best
  total across the sum of their individual race scores. This can change
  a boat's best strategy in an individual race to not be finishing
  first. Instead, preventing a close-ranked competitor from 
  placing well may lead to the best total result.
- A *series* is like a regatta, but takes place over a long period of
  time, often an entire season. Because of the long time period,
  not all boats may be able to participate in all races. A common
  rule is that each boat scores one point for every other boat that
  it beats in a race. A boat's series score is the sum of their race
  scores. So, participating and performing well in the individual
  races in which many others participate is more important than
  attending every race.
