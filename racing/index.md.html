![The comaraderie and exciting competition of racing, here in<br>a Laser (ILCA) single-handed competition.](laser-teaser.jpg width=550 attriburl="https://www.laserinternational.org/" attrib="ILCA")
The joke definition of a race is "any two sailboats on the same body
of water," and it true enough--most sailors are motivated to trim
their sails and squeeze out another knot of boat speed when another
boat appears. That core instinct taken to the next level has given us formal sailboat racing.

Racing has many variations that are described in the Race Types section.
However, whether sailed in professional national boats or
motley club sailors on a Wednesday night, all sailboat races are
governed by the
[racing rules of sailing](https://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/racing-rules-of-sailing/)
produced by World Sailing. These rules are revised every two years,
and modified for particular boat classes and events. National
variations are also published, for example US Sailing and Sail Canada
produce their own specializations. 

In this article I focus on the basic rules (which seldom change) and
their application for recreational racing. That case is both what most
sailors experience first and also the basis for varsity, national,
world class, and Olympic competition.

Your First Races
=========================================================================

Here's a brief guide to how to get started with racing. Keep your
expecations low for performance on your first few races and focus on
getting comfortable with the process and meeting the other
sailors. This section is intentionally oversimplified and covers the
most common case and general rules of thumb.

Step by Step
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<ol>
 <li>
   *Before the race, ensure that your boat is in good condition and
   ready to sail.* 
   
   Check all safety system and equipment. That includes
   PFDs, sunscreen, and drinking water. Then brief your crew and make ready to sail but do not raise the sail or cast off. For one-design races
   that are between identical boats, ensure that your boat is class legal.
 </li>
 <li>
   *Attend the skipper's meeting* on shore before the race to register,
   learn any special rules that the race committee is setting, and
   what the course is. You'll probably need to know:

   - Handicap PHRF, Portsmouth number, or DPN if all boats are not of the same design
   - Length of your boat
   - Name and sail number of your boat
   - Number of people on your boat

   For some casual series, there is no meeting and you check in with
   the committee boat on the water.
 </li>
 <li> 
   *Sail around near the start line and stay behind it. That is downwind of the line.*
   
   The start line is usually between an anchored *race
   committee boat* and a floating anchored ball called the *pin mark*.  The
   boat is at the starboard end of the line when you are facing
   towards the course and the pin is at the port end.
 </li>
 <li>
   *Observe the starting sequence and use it to time your start.*
   The race starting sequence is as follows:
  
   - Rapid sequence of sound signals blown to get everyone's attention (beep beep beep beep...)
   - -5 Minutes: Flag raised and one sound signal. The flag is authoritative and the sound is a courtesy.
   - -4 Minutes: Second flag raised and one sound signal.
   - -1 Minutes: Second flag lowered and one sound signal.
   - -0 Minutes: First flag lowered and one sound signal, usually long.
   
   For your first races, try to cross the line shortly after the
   start signal and on starboard tack. Try to be near the middle of the
   line so that you don't have to worry about being squeezed out or
   figuring out which side is favored.
   
   If there is a bad start and a recall (that is, a do-over), then the
   committee will immediately repeat the entire process, beginning
   with a large number of sound signals.
   
   
!!! Warning Starting Penalty (Rule 30)
   If you crossed the line too early, the committee will make a sound
   signal, raise a flag, and announce your boat name or number _after the start_. If
   this happens, just stay out of everyone's way. Cross back so that your
   hull is completely on the pre-start side of the line, and then
   start again. Unless a specific penalty flag is raised, you do not
   have to circle around the pin or committee boat.
</li>
<li>
   *Go around the marks (anchored floats) of the course, taking them
   all on your port side. Do not hit the marks or other boats.*
   
   Do not use artificial propulsion such as a motor, paddle, rocking your
   boat, or sculling with your rudder. Beware that there are complex
   right of way rules at the mark that you do not yet know and
   conservatively give everyone lots of room.
   
   
!!! Warning Rule 31 and Part 2 Penalties
   If someone in another boat says "protest" or that you "fouled them" (Part 2 penalties), then stay 
   clear of other boats and take a *two-turn penalty*: tack, immediately gybe, tack again, gybe again, and then continue sailing in the original
   direction. If you only hit a mark (rule 31), take a *one-turn* penalty instead.
</li>
<li> 
   *Keep sailing until you cross the finish line*.
   
   You finish when any part of the *hull* crosses the line. The
   committee will make a sound signal when you cross. After finishing,
   stay clear of other boats that are still racing. If there are a
   series of races planned and you are really far behind (not just
   last place, but 10 minutes behind the second to last boat),
   consider *abandoning* that race to get set up in time for the next
   one and skip the last marks.
</li>
</ol>


Scores
---------------------------------------------------------------

Finish ranks (scores) are determined by the time at which boats
crossed the finish line. If all boats are the same type then this is
generally the order in which they finished.

![Tracks from 117 boats in the<br>2019 Draycote Dash handicap race](draycote.png width=320 attriburl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7RPpJ0nCW0" attrib="Mozzy Sails")
If the boats are different from each other, then their measured
*course times (CT)* will be modified based on their handicaps to
produce *adjusted times (AT)* on which the boats are ranked. In some
cases, time penalties and compensation will be assigned based on rule
infractions.

The results will be posted after the race with corrected times. Note
that finishing on corrected time ahead of another boat is all that
matters; how much a boat was ahead by and its absolute time to
complete the course do not affect ranking.


Sportspersonship
-------------------------------------------

Before the committee meeting, introduce yourself to other skippers and
don't be shy about sharing that you are new to racing. They will
probably give you good advice! They will also likely try to avoid you
on the water if practical, to give you a little more room to learn the
sport without pressure.

If may initially appear that more experienced sailors are hostile
towards you on the water. For example, shouting requests and commands
at you from another boat (which is "*hailing*" and in some cases is
mandated by the rules), or sailing on near-collision courses. That's
the nature of racing and not anger directed at you. It only seems
aggressive and personal at first because you don't yet appreciate the
rules and strategy governing that situation and stumbled into their
way. Think of what the experience might be for someone stepping into a
competitive football or basketball game for the first time.

Boats sail very close to each other in races compared to recreational
sailing. They are intended to use right of way rules and create
near-collision situations to gain advantage. Simply give everyone else
room early in your career as you figure things out. You'll quickly
learn the rules and how to sail in the pack safely and in a
sporting manner.

As you begin to learn the rules, always focus first on being a good
competitor and colleague to everyone around you: your crew, the other
sailors, the committee, and the support workers. Improving as a sailor
is your second priority. Winning is a distant third priority.

Bring lunch for your crew, treat them with patience and respect on the
water, and thank them after the race. _Especially_ if they are your
family.

Until you are in the position where you are frequently battling for
first, second, or third, just follow the rules to avoid collisions. Do
not aggressively use rules to disadvantage other boats. There is no
point in battling for a low place and making both you and the other
boat slow and frustrated. Sail fast and focus on catching up to the
leaders.

By the time that you're experienced enough to be battling for a top
finish, you'll have learned the etiquite and situations in which it is
worthwhile to leverage technicalities and intentionally attack other
boats. In the mean time, focus on learning and being the person everyone 
wants to sail with.


Safety First
=========================================================================

Something I greatly admire about sailboat racing as a sport are that
the first three rules focus solely on safety. These are:

- A boat must render any assistance to other vessels in distress (1.1)
- A boat decides for itself whether to race and continue racing (3)
- Avoiding an imminent collision superceeds all other rules governing
  right of way ("imminent" can be highly subjective beforehand, but if a
  boat _could_ have avoided a collision and one occurs, that boat is 
  retroactively deemed to be at fault)

Included in the rules for individual races are further safety rules.
These concern those governing PFD use, radios and transponders, life
rafts, and other emergency equipment.

When another boat appears to be in serious trouble (such as a damaged rig)
or is capsized, other racers
will ask if they need help as they pass. Boats will
also keep track of each other [from a distance](https://www.sailingworld.com/safety-at-speed/),
not just to monitor the competition, but to ensure that everyone in the race is safe.
Unless everything is obviously OK, they will and must offer all assistance.

Serious accidents are rare, especially in small boats. However, in the
event of danger there may be only seconds to successfully intervene
for a rescue of someone who is unconscious and in the water. Even with
committee and safety boats available, the other sailboats in the race
are the closest help and the most likely to understand the emergency.

When the sailors of a capsized boat are alright and the race is
continuing around them, the capsized boat is classified as an
*obstruction*. Rule 19 specifies how those that are passing it must
give each other room to clearly avoid it.

Elements of Racing
=========================================================================

Sailboat day racing combines multiple elements:

- Condition of the boat, through pre-race maintenance and rigging
  modifications within class rules.
- Strategy with regard to the overall path sailed, weather, and current.
- Tactics for managing interactions with nearby competitors by
  exploiting the rules.
- Crew teamwork and communication.
- Physical ability and technical skill in trimming and boat handling.

Note that physical ability / technical skill is only one of the
elements! While sailing ability is of course important, in many cases
it is the least significant factor in racing success. When every crew
in a race has a reasonable degree of boat handling teamwork, the other
factors can dominate. 

A good strategist in a well-maintained boat might handily best a crew
with more athletic prowess. As in any sport, a crew working
effectively as a team is very likely to beat those who are squabbling
or have not practiced together.


Right of Way
=========================================================================

International navigation rules (COLREGS) for when two boats meet
specify a *give-way* vessel and a *stand-on* vessel. Boats that are
racing are required to follow those rules with regard to non-racing
vessels, but are governed by modified rules with respect to each
other. 

When two boats meet in a race, one is the *give-way* vessel and the
other is the *right-of-way* vessel. Unlike in normal navigation, 
the boat with the right of way is not
required to stand on and maintain its current course and speed.  In
fact, it may and often will move in a manner that forces the give-way
vessel to make further course changes to avoid a collision.

The *give-way* vessel is required to *stay clear* and avoiding a
collision. However, the distance is generally _much_ less than in
normal navigation, where a give-way vessel must make obvious course
corrections and usually provides several boat lengths of space to the
the stand-on vessel. It varies with the size and speed of the boats
and the sea conditions.  It is not unusual for Laser racers to be only
tens of centimeters apart, or keelboats to pass within a few meters of
each other.

- Avoid collisions.
- Starboard over port. When sailing downwind, the tack that the boat
  is on is determined by the side opposite the boom.
- Leeward over windward. This means that the boat on the other side
  of your sail has right of way over you.
- A boat being overtaken has right of way over the overtaking boat;
  the boat ahead of you has right of way.

Gaining right of way is not instantaneous. When a boat gains right of
way through its own actions, it is required to stay clear of the boat
it gained rights on until that boat has room to maneuver (2.13, 2.15,
2.16).

For example, consider the case of a port tack boat that approaches a
starboard tack boat and then tacks below it. The boat that just tacked
has right of way because it is to leeward and both are on starboard
tack. However, it must give the other boat some time to adjust course
to avoid a collision if their paths intersect (2.13).

<!-- TODO: becalmed/head to wind? -->

The right of way rules are modified in certain situations:

- Detailed rules for the zone around the mark
- Boat performing penalty turns or re-starting must stay clear
- Room to clear obstructions


Simplified Rules Summary
=========================================================================

This section gives a simplified summary in relatively plain language
of the most critical and common rules. This is as an introduction and
memory aid. Racers must also read the full rules. The specific
definitions, rules, and subrules add significant detail and describe
subtleties not encapsulated here.

Key Definitions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A boat *starts* after the start signal when it approaches the line
from opposite the course side, and any part of the hull touches the
start line.

A *mark* is an object that the boat is required to pass on a specific
side, starboard or port. Boats take a penalty if they touch a mark.
Most of the marks are usually buoys, except
for the committee boat (which is not a "boat" or an "obstruction" for
the purpose of the race rules). Except for the committee boat, these
are usually passed with the mark on the port side. The anchor line is
not considered part of the mark. A boat is *fetching* a mark when it
is in position to pass it to windward on the correct side.

The *zone* around a mark is a region of the water within three hull
lengths of the mark, where the length of the boat closest to the mark
is used. There are special right of way rules within the zone. A boat
is in the zone when any part of its hull is in the zone.

A *leg* of a course is the section between marks that a boat must pass
in sequence. A leg is often not sailed straight as boats must tack or
gybe to hit their fastest point of sail. The definition of leg is
particular relevant for two rules. Rule 28.1 says that a boat can sail
on either side of marks that are to not define the leg it is currently
on. Rule 18's zone restrictions do not apply to a boat that has rounded a
mark and left it clear astern.

A boat's *proper course* is the course it would choose to sail to
finish as fast as possible in the absence of other boats. This only
exists after the boat has started and before it has finished. Proper
course matters for rules 17 and 18.4, which essentially use it to
ensure that a boat can't sail into the wind or wide of a mark and then
use right of way rules to force someone else to also do so.

An *obstruction* is anything that must be navigated around or on a
specific side to avoid a collision, except for a mark surrounded by
navigable water on all sides. Obstructions create exceptions to the
other right of way rules.  Obstructions include docks, bridge pilings,
sandbars, anchored boats, and capsized boats. A boat underway that one
is required by navigation or racing rules to keep clear of is an
obstruction. Note that the committee boat is not an obstruction as
long as a boat can pass on either side of it.

A boat *finishes* when it approaches the finish line from the course
side and any part of the hull touches the finish line. It is not
necessary to _cross_ the finish line. It is important to clear away
from the course, as a boat that continues to sail the course is then
retroactively _not_ finished.

Racers must *hail* (shout at) each other in certain circumstances, and
generally communicate more between boats than in recreational
sailing. The hails are to notify others of intentions to avoid
collisions ("I'm about to tack") in tight quarters, request or confirm
entitled space for navigation ("I need room at the mark"), and protest
each other's actions ("you just fouled me by not staying clear during
your tack under rule 2.13").


Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Give all help to a person or vessel in danger (1.1)
- Port tack stay clear of starboard (10)
- Leeward stay clear of windward (11)
- Astern stay clear of ahead (12)
- Avoid collisions (14)
- Proper course (17): When _upwind on the same tack_, the
  leeward boat can't force a give-way competitor to pinch, 
  tack, or round the mark wide just to slow them down.
- Mark-Room (18):
  - Scope (18.1): Mark-room applies to boats _approaching_ a mark,
    upwind on the _same tack_, that will _both_ round without tacking, 
    or downwind on any tacks, when at least one of them is in the zone
  - Overlap (18.2):
     - If two boats are overlapped
       when the first reaches the zone, the outside boat
       must give the inside boat room to round the mark even if the overlap
       is later broken.
     - If not overlapped when reaching the zone, the astern
       boat must give room to the ahead boat even if an overlap is later
       established.
  - Tacking (18.3): A boat that tacks inside of the zone can't force a
    windward boat above close hauled and must give room to all inside
    overlapped boats. Tacking also causes a boat to lose its
    rights based on overlap (18.2.d).
    This typically only applies to tacking onto starboard and
    becoming the leeward boat, since the other cases are already covered by 
    non-mark rounding rules.
  - Gybe mark (18.4): An inside and overlapped boat must gybe promptly 
    after a (non-gate) gybe mark so as to not force give-way competitors
    to sail wide
- Obstruction (19): Generally give room at an an obstruction as if
  it was a mark. 
- Room to tack at an obstruction (20):  
  - If you need to tack to avoid a boat on the same tack,
    must hail. The other boat then either tacks itself
    or says "you tack" and gives room.
- Keep clear when taking a penalty (21)
- When not racing, keep clear of boats that are (23),
  for example, after finishing get out of the way
  of the other boats and before the start stay away
  from other races.
- Marks only affect the current leg being sailed (28)
  and can otherwise be ignored.




Study the official text of rule 18 carefully. It is complicated and is the
rule that most commonly affects critical situations.


Protests
=========================================================================

Boats are expected to voluntarily obey the rules. In sailboat racing,
if you make a mistake, you must take the penalty regardless of whether
anyone sees your infraction or complains about it. Because of this, it
is also the case that except for the start and finish, it is not
generally the race committee's job to enforce the rules. This is in
stark contrast to many other sports in which rules are externally
enforced on competitors, and is something I find both pragmatic and
charming.

A *protest* is a formal way of notifying another boat that they have
broken a rule. This usually happens because they were unaware of
exactly what happened, not because they were trying to cheat and got
caught.  In some complicated situations, boats are also required to
protest for the penalty to be mandated.

Depending on the style of racing and the gravity of the infraction, a
protest may vary from simply hailing someone to take penalty turns on
the water, up to flying specific flags and triggering formal hearing
on shore after the race resembling a trial. In some situations it is
also possible to protest the race committee itself.

For the beginning racer, do not protest anyone. Wait until you deeply
understand the rules and the etiquite of your particular racing
venue. If someone protests you, do not argue. Just take the penalty
regardless of whether you understand the problem or think that you were
in the right.


Race Types
=========================================================================

![2022 Sydney-Hobart Race start.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/77th_Rolex_Sydney_Hobart_Yacht_Race_at_16_minutes_in.jpg attrib="CC BY-SA 4.0 Dicklyon")

Races are categorized as:

- *One-design* races in production boats, where all boats are
  identical.
- *Mixed-class* production boat club races, where Portsmouth (dinghy) and PHRF
  (keelboat) handicaps are applied to well known boat classes for fairness by adjusting the
  *time* sailed. Sometimes the time is preadjusted based on the length
  of the course and start times are staggered, so that the first boat
  to finish will win.
- *Mixed-design* offshore yacht races using [ORC](https://orc.org/), 
  [ORR](https://www.offshoreracingrule.org/), and 
  [IRC](https://ircrating.org/) measurement based handicaps.
- *Design-rule* races in custom boats, where an equation for boat
  metrics and set of training rules gives creative design freedom
  while governing overall fairness.

The diversity of sailboat races includes:

- [College varsity dinghies](https://www.collegesailing.org/), typically 20 minute races
  with ten to forty single- or double-handed boats organized in weekend regattas
- One design national, regional, and world regattas (e.g., [ILCA](https://sailing.laserinternational.org/site/event-list),
  [420](https://420sailing.org/content/420-world-championships), [RS200](https://www.rs200sailing.org/), 
  [49er](https://49er.org/event/2022-world-championship/))
- Offshore and cross-ocean races, which are typically multi-day and on large keelboats or catamarans.
  Fatigue is a major factor. The largest of these include
  the [Fastnet](https://www.rolexfastnetrace.com/en/), [Sydney-Hobart](https://rolexsydneyhobart.com/),
  [Newport-Bermuda](https://bermudarace.com/), 
  [Transpac](https://transpacyc.com/), 
  [Route du Rhum](https://www.routedurhum.com/en),
  [Transat](https://www.thetransat.com/the-race) and
  [Mini Transat](https://minitransat.fr/),
  and [The Ocean (aka Volvo, Whitbread)](https://www.theoceanrace.com/).
- [America's Cup](https://www.americascup.com/), which today is a set of match races between
  design-rule boats fielded by nations
- [SailGP](https://sailgp.com/), similar to formula one car racing for foiling catamarans
- Around the world races (e.g., [Clipper](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/),
  [Golden Globe](https://goldengloberace.com/),
  [Vendée Globe](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/),
  [Barcelona](https://www.barcelonaworldrace.org/en/)), where
  weather forecasting, navigation, maintenance underway, and endurance
  are core parts of the challenge and the race may take months to years 
  to complete!
  

Because the absolute time does not matter in most scoring, sailing
_fast_ is not as important as sailing _faster_ than the
competition. This means that a large part of strategy in a sailboat
race is creating situations in which the rules favor one's own
boat and prevent competitors from gaining ground or passing.

Some scoring variations beyond first-across-the-line can create more
complex strategic goals:

- *Handicap* (PHRF, Portsmouth) races are won based on *adjusted time* (AT) instead of
  *course time* (CT) finishes. A fast boat that will have to "give time"
  needs to avoid battling individual other fast competitors. Instead, it
  must focus on minimizing its total time relative to slower boats that
  it has no way of directly fighting.
- *Pursuit* races are a variation on handicap races. Each boat is assigned
  a start time based on its handicap. The first across the line wins,
  because the time adjustment was preapplied. This essentially shifts the
  end time adjustment to the start time. Ideally this would increase the
  amount of interaction and excitement at the end of the race, while
  reducing interaction at the congested start.
- *Match* races have only two boats facing off head-to-head.
- *Team racing* is scored by the finish positions of a set of boats
  that sail together as a team. Instead of individually sailing to
  finish first, they collaborate to slow competitors and ensure that
  their fleet's set of finish positions is collectively higher than
  their opponents'.
- A *regatta* is a set of races in which the winner has the best
  total across the sum of their individual race scores. This can change
  a boat's best strategy in an individual race to not be finishing
  first. Instead, preventing a close-ranked competitor from 
  placing well may lead to the best total result.
- A *series* is like a regatta, but takes place over a long period of
  time, often an entire season. Because of the long time period,
  not all boats may be able to participate in all races. A common
  rule is that each boat scores one point for every other boat that
  it beats in a race. A boat's series score is the sum of their race
  scores. So, participating and performing well in the individual
  races in which many others participate is more important than
  attending every race.

A
[*rabbit start*](https://alsargent.medium.com/how-to-do-rabbit-starts-in-sailing-65e653ab17f2)
can be used when a race committee and committee boat are not
available.
