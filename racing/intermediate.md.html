                      **Dinghy Racing Tactics**
              Published 2023-08-05; Updated 2023-10-08

This article describes intermediate sailboat racing tactics, with an
emphasis on dinghy racing. Dinghies are often twice as fast as
keelboats, use simpler controls, and are extremely agile, so can
leverage more aggressive maneuvers during racing. The high level
tactics and some of the strategy from dinghy racing apply to keelboat
racing as well.

See also the [introduction](beginner.md.html) to racing
and [rules](rules.md.html) summary articles.

The core strategy for placing well in a race sounds obvious, but is
easy to forget in the excitement of competition: *start first* and
then *sail fast*.

Avoid battling other boats, and in fact, avoid other boats as much as
possible entirely, favoring clear air and uncontested lines. In the
cases when you absolutely must battle at the start, marks, or finish,
know your attacks and defenses.


Start First
======================================================================

Stay Close to the Line
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay close to the line. If you are far away then any mistake or wind
shift or lull can make it hard to recover and reach the line in time.

I usually prefer to be above the line on one side or the other, but
outside of the starting line-to-first-mark triangle that may be
prohibited (and is a dangerous place to be even if not prohibited!) If
the wind shifts or falls then you can still sail a reach towards the
pin or committee boat from above the line, but if you are far downwind
then it may be very hard to make up ground.

I leave my vang off completely and sheet loosely before the start.
This slows the boat and allows me to sit in, conserving energy, while
still keeping sufficient way to maneuver and look for my starting
position. It also allows me to move slowly without luffing, as luffing
puts significant wear on the sail.

In strong wind with a dinghy, I will luff on starboard in the last 30
seconds right below the line. In that case there's plenty of wind
to accelerate at the last moment so there is no need to approach 
the line at speed. In moderate to low wind I keep some speed so that
I'm not accelerating from a standstill at the last moment.

Choose Your Tack
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To maintain rights, starting on starboard is common and almost
exclusively used.

In some cases the wind shifts so that port tack is significantly
favored by pointing more directly at the first mark when close
hauled. The best way to take advantage of this is to start closer to
the committee end of the line. Then you can tack to port immediately after
the start. If you were the highest boat or started first, then you
can sail off into clean air on the favored tack. If you were in the middle of
the pack or started a bit late, then you have to duck through dirty
air behind others, but are then on a better tack and can make up
ground.

Only if very lucky in finding a wide hole on the starting line or
unlucky and starting very late is it feasible to cross the line on
port.


Make Your Slot
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The best starting position at 5-10 seconds is approaching the line on
starboard while pinching with at least a full boat length clear to
leeward. This gives room to fall off into the hole to leeward and
accelerate that the last moment.  If instead there is another boat
immediately to leeward on the same tack, then it has right of way and
you are stuck pinching, which will be very slow.

As other boats clump up towards the start line, try to sail behind
them on a reach (which is fast), and then turn up close to leeward of
another boat leaving a large hole to your leeward side. This cuts off
(well, steals) their hole for acceleration and gives you room for your
start.

Of course, everyone is trying to do the same thing to you. So, you
have to defend your hole. One way to do this is to stay near luffing
while pointed low. That prevents someone else from sailing right into
you as they overtake, although you will have to head up once they are
overlapped.  Then, pinch up when force the boat to windward to pinch
and create more space to your leeward. Before the start, _there is no
proper course_, so you can pinch as high as you wish as long as you
don't force another boat head to wind.

If your hole disappears sooner than 15 seconds before the start,
consider backwinding the main to slide out backwards, fall off, and
sail further down the line to steal another slot.

As soon as a boat touches the line (after the signal), it has started.
That boat can no longer sail above its proper course and luff a
windward boat. As windward, you can object if they tell you to head up
when they are obviously above their proper course _after_ they started
(even if you have not started yet).

Windward Start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In a less aggressive fleet, being the most windward boat is a
fantastic starting position. To achieve this, come down from above the
committee boat on a deep reach at full speed, head up hard around the
committee boat at about two seconds to the start, and cross the line
as the closest boat to it on starboard tack.

If you started enough ahead of the next boat to leeward, then you can
continue on starboard tack with the benefit of clean air. If the next
boat to leeward is right against you, then you can tack to port and
sail off into clean air.

The limitation of this tactic is that a boat immediately to leeward
that knows what you are doing may head you up and close the room to
the committee boat, which you do not receive mark room for at the start.

This means that they can force you to entirely miss your start. If
they successfully squeeze you out, then you'll have to tack at the
last moment before the committee boat, gybe around, and start
far behind them.

If you contact the leeward boat or force it to change course to avoid
you, then this is called *barging*. In addition to the regular
penalties for fouling the other boat, this particular foul is likely
to do serious damage to your reputation as it is highly avoidable.

Only attempt to squeeze in next to the committee boat if you are sure
you'll have enough room _even if the next leeward boat luffs up to
block you_. In an aggressive fleet with a tight line, you are unlikely
to have that much room often.

On the other hand, if you see someone else attempting to squeeze in to
windward, do not immediately try to head them up. Consider whether
cutting them off will force you to start more slowly by pinching while
others are falling off to accelerate. Also consider whether you are
making a collision unavoidable due to their speed and inability to get
clear of the committee boat. If they are on a collision course and you
are able to prevent a collision, you must do so and protest them,
otherwise you are also in the wrong.


Timing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The start countdown has signals at 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 1 minute, and
go. 

Prep the countdown timer on your watch ahead of time. Start it at
5 minutes, and then verify that it is accurate at 4 minutes. If your
timer is off, don't bother resetting it. Just keep track of what the
offset is in seconds and verify again at one minute.

Use the starting sequence time to sail starting feints. Calibrate the
point at which you need to start making for the line to hit it within
20 seconds. In the last minute especially, note how the wind is
shifting and look ahead for gusts or lulls and adjust your turn
point. Then, hit that point at 20 seconds, tack or gybe and start
sailing for the line.

Launch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
At about four seconds before the start when you are nearly at the line, 
bear off from close hauled to accelerate. It will feel like you're doing
this slightly too early, and you just have to trust your practice and
commit.

When the boat has picked up some speed sailing low, tighten the vang,
sheet in, and slide your weight forward and towards the
centerline. These actions will cause the boat to heel and turn up to
close hauled, accelerating as it does so. Hike hard to flatten the
boat when you are at maximum speed and pointing high and cross the
line flat and fast. Note that you may not pump or rock under rule 42,
but you can use your weight to steer the boat and to flatten the boat
in this way so long as you are not doing it repeatedly.

If it is very light wind then you may need more than four seconds.
If it is very strong wind or waves then you may need to adjust your
start process to avoid capsizing and to maintain control when packed
tightly in the fleet.


Sail Fast
======================================================================

Trim Well
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I observe most intermediate racers tend to overtrim sails when excited
while upwind and heeling, especially on the first upwind leg. Remember
your fundamentals. If you are heeling, do not keep tightening the sail
or you'll exacerbate it and sail slower. Hike and then flatten the
sail with the cunningham and vang.  If you must, raise the centerboard
a little, or ease the vang and main if seriously overpowered. Heeling
feels fast, but is slow.

Especially in light wind, do not overtrim or pinch upwind. Get the
boat sailing fast first. Don't hyperfocus on the boats around you and
neglect your own. Look at your sail and adjust it continuously, glancing
at others instead of staring at them.


Velocity Made Good (VMG)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pointing as close as possible at a mark, whether upwind or downwind, is
rarely the fastest way to reach it. A boat pointing very high or running
moves slowly, but in the right direction. A boat that is close hauled
at a low angle or on a deep reach moves faster, but in a slightly wrong
direction.

*Velocity made good (VMG)* measures how fast you are moving towards
your goal. (For those familiar with vector mathematics, this is just a
dot product of course and bearing to the mark, times the speed over
ground.) The direction that maximizes VMG is slightly lower than the
highest you can point for an upwind mark, and for most boats, is
higher than running directly towards a downwind mark.

This is especially true for a planing dinghy. In conditions that are just
on the verge of planing, it is much faster to sail slightly away from the
mark to reach planing speed, and then turn more towards the mark. Once
planing the boat exceeds its hull speed limitation. Then, the apparent
wind comes around, allowing it to reach even deeper or to point
very high while close hauled without excesssive heel.


Clean Air
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stay away from other boats as much as possible. This avoids being
forced onto an awkward point of sail and right-of-way attacks, but it
also ensures that you have clean air. The air is blocked within about
two boat lengths downwind of another boat, and turbulent for at least
ten boat lengths. Staying in clean air flow is the key to moving fast.

When passing another boat, try to pass to windward, blocking _their_
wind and slowing them, but risking being headed up yourself. Or, pass
very far to leeward so that your wind is not blocked, and so that
you can get through their turbulent air as quickly as possible.

In a mixed class fleet, this is especially important. When downwind
of any boat with larger sails you are at an extreme disadvantage from
their disproportionately large wind shadow. The worst case is when
running in a catboat and in the lead, with boats that are wing-on-wind
or flying spinnakers behind you casting huge shadows.


Current
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Local knowledge is critical with regard to wind shifts and strength
changes, especially when near a developed shore or cliff, or on a lake.
It is also critical for river current or tides. Look up the tide changes
and plan ahead for how the current will affect the course and when it
will change throughout the race. Learn what underwater features or side
flows cause eddies and variations in the current.

Currents are usually stronger in deeper water. When sailing against
current, seek shallower water, balancing it against the likelihood of
the wind also being more disturbed near shore. When sailing with
current, head to deeper water to take more advantage of it.


Sail to the Wind
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sail where the wind is, and on the favored tacks. Look ahead on the
course to see puffs coming, and pay attention to whether the puffs are
usually lifts or headers. Sail towards the puffs, tacking or adjusting
course slightly to reach them first. 

Link together a chain of puffs, ideally all lifts. When entering or
exiting a puff, consider whether the current tack is still favored,
and tack over if not.

Attend to where the wind is stronger. On a river or narrow lake, this
is often in the middle or closer to the leeward shore. If there are
buildings or trees, the wind may also change direction significantly
near the shore. 

Prepare for Anything
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose the right rig for the conditions. Not the conditions at the start,
but the average conditions throughout the race or regatta. If you'll
be overpowered most of the time, drop down to a smaller rig or reef.
A boat with smaller sails that is not overpowered is faster than one
with large sails that must overflatten or luff them.

After selecting the appropriate rig (and stay tension, and mast rake,
etc.), also prepare your gear as best as possible against any change
in conditions. For example, if you need a helmet or trapeze harness
in strong conditions, always wear them so that you're ready if the
wind picks up. If you have optional takeups for control lines (such as
an outhaul bungee), rig regardless of the conditions. If your boat
can reef, ensure that it is prepared for this when you set out.


Never Give Up
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equipment failure (through breakage or misuse) is a natural part of
all sailboat racing, and capsize is a natural part of dinghy
racing. Either can suddenly upend the order in a race. Someone a full
minute ahead of you can fumble their spinnaker douse and end up behind
you. 

I've seen several dinghy races in high wind won simply by the boat
that capsized the least. Even in moderate wind, it is easy for an
experienced sailor to capsize due to stepping on a line at the wrong
time or something tangling. That could be your opening to pass them.

Good sportspersonship demands that you complete races you start unless
it is unsafe or you are physically unable. It is also good training.
You gain experience and should have a sense of accomplishment sailing
across the line in any position. Do not abandon races lightly.

Sail as fast as you can regardless of your position. That's
how you learn more, prove yourself a worthy competitor, and have a
chance at placing well when someone else makes a mistake.



Attacks
=======================================================================

When to Attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've repeated the advice many times here: avoid attacking other boats.
It is usually faster to stay away from them and sail fast than to
battle someone else and make you both slower. Attacking a boat that is
on another leg is never useful--one of you is definitely so far ahead
of the other that interaction is pointless.

However, at the start, at marks, and at the finish you are constrained
in your course and there will be congestion. So, you have to battle in
these conditions or get stuck behind others, and potentially far
behind if that leads to sailing in disturbed air.

The reason to attack another boat is that you are trying to pass it in
one of these constrained situations. Attacking otherwise is generally
pointless and will hurt you (and also not make any friends).

There are a few exceptions where it is useful to attack another boats
solely to slow them down, without making yourself faster. These are
team racing, match racing, and taking down the first place boat in a
regatta when you are second and need only to beat _them_ over the
series.

Also note that in attacks you must not sail beyond your proper course,
which includes not rounding marks wide. You also must not actually
create contact. If there is contact that you could avoided, then you
have broken the rules. For a good attack, create the conditions that
would lead to contact and where you have right of way, but where the
other boat has enough time and room to maneuver safely.


Upwind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Passing to windward of another boat, blocking its wind and sailing past,
is usually the best way to pass. 

When conditions instead indicate passing to leeward, attack by heading
up the other boat. You can head up as high as your own proper course.
That may include pinching a little, as long as you are not headed
above the bearing to the mark or luffing. The rules specify that your
proper course is the path you'd sail to finish as fast as possible in
the absence of the other boat. This gets tricky because of VMG
considerations, but if your sail is full and you are not pointed above
the layline then you are probably OK. 

After the windward boat heads up (or tacks) to stay clear, fall off
again to get more speed and open up some room away from it. While they
are slowed, you can then bear off quickly towards cleaner air. This is
similar to bearing off just before the start to accelerate.

If the windward boat established the overlap (i.e., they came up on you from astern)
or you established the overlap from two hull lengths away, or you tacked under
them to create the overlap, then you can head _above_ your proper course to head up
the other boat.

As you approach the zone around an upwind mark and are just astern of
another boat, bearing away to a faster course to duck inside and
establish overlap can give you mark room. You can then head up towards
the mark to slow them and make a clean rounding.

Downwind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Downwind is a good opportunity to catch up to a leader. The trailing
boats receive the wind first, so are accelerated first by puffs, which
gives them the ability to steer to block or spoil the wind of the
downwind leader.  Because the leader is in that turbulent air, they
have less maneuverability can't defend effectively to escape in the
way that a windward boat can when sailing upwind, so that when the
puff ends, they are still trapped.

Anyone on port is vulnerable downwind prior to the mark zone. A
starboard boat can come in on a converging course and force them to
gybe, but after the gybe they can be forced further by the attacker,
who is now to leeward.

A leeward boat can head up another boat as far as its own proper
course. Because the proper course (i.e., fastest course) for a boat
without a symmetric spinnaker is a deep reach, it is possible to force
a competitor quite far off the layline.

When sailing mixed class, a boat with a symmetric spinnaker is
particularly vulnerable to catboats and asymmetric spinnaker boats,
because the attacker can force the symmetric spinnaker far off its
chosen course.

Note that the even the proper course restriction does not apply if
the overlap was established by gybing. An attacker can come in on starboard and
estabish overlap and then gybe twice. That resets the overlap without
the overtacking condition, allowing them to then freely head up the other
boat. Of course, heading above your own proper course by definition makes
you slow, so usually you'll want to come back down to your desired
course as soon as you forced off the target.

Recall that downwind, an inside boat on port tack still receives mark
room from a boat on starboard tack, so long as it is overlapped when
the first boat enters the zone.


Defenses
=======================================================================

Upwind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A leeward boat can head up a windward boat that is attempting to pass it.
Doing so makes you slow, so after the start this is often not a good
defense. Instead, sailing lower to accelerate and get back ahead is
often wise.

Another defense is to pinch up well in advance, when they are still
overtaking.  Then you can sit to windward; you won't have right of
way, but you will be blocking their wind and they will likely have to
fall off to a more oblique course to pass.

Note that if the other boat overtook you to leeward, then proper
course does not apply. You may head as high as you wish to defend from
an overtaking boat. It is only when you established the overlap by
overtaking that you are restricted to your proper course.


Downwind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If another boat gets mark room from you at a downwind mark, avoid being
forced to sail around them to the next leg, making a very large turn.
Instead, consider intentionally slowing a little and turning more sharply
than them so that you can come inside after the rounding. They no longer
receive mark room after they have rounded the mark, and if it is a gybe
mark then you can become the leeward boat after the rounding and have
rights.

Be careful with changing course near a mark when trying to prevent
an overtaking boat from establishing overlap. When you turn, you change
the angle of your stern. If you are turning _towards_ another boat to
cut them off, then you are also turning your stern so that they will
have established overlap sooner. Instead, turning away can paradoxically
be a good defense, as it can prevent or break an overlap.

Avoid ever being on port tack when running downwind in the middle of a
pack. You can end up having to keep clear both of leeward port boats
and of starboard boats, and doing so where you don't have enough room
to gybe to change it.
