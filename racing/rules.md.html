![The comaraderie and exciting competition of racing, here in<br>a Laser (ILCA) single-handed dinghy racing.](laser-teaser.jpg width=550 attriburl="https://www.laserinternational.org/" attrib="ILCA")

This article introduces the 
[racing rules of sailing (RRS)](https://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/racing-rules-of-sailing/)
for sailors
comfortable with at least [novice boathandling](../trim/novice.md.html)
and [the basics of racing](beginner.md.html) and ready to learn
more about the rules.

As described in the Race Types section, there are many kinds of
sailboat races.  They build from the same rule set, so learning these
rules prepares you both to participate in local day races and to
follow (and maybe some day participate in!)  sailboat racing at any
level, including Olympic and around the world races.

The numbers in parentheses throughout this article are the rule
numbers from RRS. In addition to this article, you should read the
full rule set and have reasonable familiarity with Part 2 and
especially rule 18. The specific definitions, rules, and subrules add
significant detail and describe subtleties not encapsulated here.

The full rules are also admittedly complex and subject to
interpretation, at the level of legislation or academic
literature. So, this article will help prepare you for proper racing
with knowledge of the rules without burdening you with full details in
the summary. If you learn everything here, then you will have
understanding at about the level of most racers with a year or two of
college or club racing experience.


Elements of Racing
=========================================================================

Sailboat day racing combines multiple elements:

- Condition of the boat, through pre-race maintenance and rigging
  modifications within class rules.
- Strategy with regard to the overall path sailed, weather, and current.
- Tactics for managing interactions with nearby competitors by
  exploiting the rules.
- Crew teamwork and communication.
- Physical ability and technical skill in trimming and boat handling.

Note that physical ability / technical skill is only one of the
elements! While sailing ability is of course important, in many cases
it is the least significant factor in racing success. When every crew
in a race has a reasonable degree of boat handling, the other factors
can dominate.

A good strategist in a well-maintained boat might handily best a crew
with more athletic prowess. As in any sport, a crew working
effectively as a team is very likely to beat those who are squabbling
or have not practiced together. The best execution of a terrible
chosen path will still lead to a loss over the boat that sails the
windier part of the course.


Right of Way
=========================================================================

International navigation rules (COLREGS) for when two boats meet
specify a *give-way* vessel and a *stand-on* vessel. Boats that are
racing are required to follow those rules with regard to non-racing
vessels, but are governed by modified rules with respect to each
other. 

When two boats meet in a race, one is the *give-way* vessel and the
other is the *right-of-way* vessel. Unlike in normal navigation, the
boat with the right of way is not required to stand on and maintain
its current course and speed.  In fact, it may and often will move in
a manner that forces the give-way vessel to make further course
changes to avoid a collision.

The *give-way* vessel is required to *keep clear* and avoiding a
collision. However, the distance is generally _much_ less than in
normal navigation, where a give-way vessel must make obvious course
corrections and usually provides several boat lengths of space to the
the stand-on vessel. It varies with the size and speed of the boats
and the sea conditions.  It is not unusual for Laser racers to be only
tens of centimeters apart, or keelboats to pass within a few meters of
each other.

Gaining right of way is not instantaneous. When a boat gains right of
way through its own actions, it is required to keep clear of the boat
it gained rights on until that boat has room to maneuver (13, 15,
16).

For example, consider the case of a port tack boat that approaches a
starboard tack boat and then tacks below it. The boat that just tacked
has right of way because it is to leeward and both are on starboard
tack. However, it must give the other boat some time to adjust course
to avoid a collision if their paths intersect (13, 16). This situation often
arises at the start of a race.

The right of way rules are modified in certain situations:

- Detailed rules for the zone around the mark
- Boat performing penalty turns or re-starting must stay clear
- Room to clear obstructions


Definitions
=========================================================================

The *start line* is between the windward edge of the port end *pin*
(usually a buoy) and the staff flying the orange flag at the starboard
end (usually on an anchored committee boat). The start line is usually
1 to 2 times the total length of all boats in the fleet. A longer line
is easier for beginners and a shorter line is more competitive for
experienced racers. The *finish line* is often the same line as the
start line. 

The start and finish are typically both upwind points of sail and the
lines are nearly perpendicular to the wind, although downwind finishes
are not uncommon. Downwind and reaching starts are rare.

A boat *starts* after the start signal when it approaches the line
from opposite the course side, and any part of the hull touches the
start line.

A boat's *proper course* is the course it would choose to sail to
finish as fast as possible in the absence of other boats. This only
exists after the boat has started and before it has finished. Proper
course matters for rules 17 and 18.4, which essentially use it to
ensure that a boat can't sail into the wind or wide of a mark and then
use right of way rules to force someone else to also do so.

A boat that must *keep clear* of another must allow that other boat
sufficient room to sail its current course
[without risk of collision](https://www.sailingworld.com/how-to/how-close-too-close/),
as well suffient room to change course in either direction without
immediately provoking a collision. This includes easing its sail or
heeling. The exception is that a leeward boat that sailed into the
that position (instead of having the windward boat approach from astern)
cannot head above its proper course, which upwind means it cannot
tack.

A *mark* is an object that the boat is required to pass on a specific
side, starboard or port. Boats take a penalty if they touch a mark.
Most of the marks are usually buoys, except
for the committee boat (which is not a "boat" or an "obstruction" for
the purpose of the race rules). Except for the committee boat, these
are usually passed with the mark on the port side. The anchor line is
not considered part of the mark. A boat is *fetching* a mark when it
is in position to pass it to windward on the correct side.

The *zone* around a mark is a region of the water within three hull
lengths of the mark, where the length of the boat closest to the mark
is used. There are special right of way rules within the zone. A boat
is in the zone when any part of its hull is in the zone.

![Left: Large blue is nearer to the mark, so the zone is three blue hull lengths in radius. Right:
 Small orange is nearer to the mark, so the zone is much smaller.](rules/zone.svg)

A *gate* is defined by two marks, where the boats may choose which one
to round based on their position and the prevailing conditions. Most
courses do not contain gates.

A *leg* of a course is the section between marks that a boat must pass
in sequence. A leg is often not sailed straight as boats must tack or
gybe to hit their fastest point of sail. The definition of leg is
particular relevant for two rules. Rule 28.1 says that a boat can sail
on either side of marks that are to not define the leg it is currently
on. Rule 18's zone restrictions do not apply to a boat that has rounded a
mark and left it clear astern.

An *obstruction* is anything that must be navigated around or on a
specific side to avoid a collision, except for a mark surrounded by
navigable water on all sides. Obstructions create exceptions to the
other right of way rules. Obstructions include docks, bridge pilings,
sandbars, anchored boats, and capsized boats. A boat underway that one
is required by navigation or racing rules to keep clear of is an
obstruction. Note that the committee boat is not an obstruction as
long as a boat can pass on either side of it.

Racers must *hail* (shout at) each other in certain circumstances, and
generally communicate more between boats than in recreational
sailing. The hails are for several purposes. They can notify others
of intentions to help avoid collisions in tight quarters, such as "I'm
about to gybe" (optional). They can request or confirm entitled space
for navigation (mandatory, 20) such as, "I need room at the mark".
They are also to protest each other's actions (mandatory, 61.1), such
as "Protest! You fouled me by not staying clear during your tack under
rule 13."

A boat is *clear ahead* if an imaginary line parallel to its transom
does not go through the other boat, which is then the *clear astern* 
boat. 

Two boats are *overlapped* when neither is clear ahead _or_ when they
are overlapped with some set of boats between them, creating a chain
of overlaps. This creates the somewhat confusing case where two boats
that are sailing towards each other are considered "overlapped" as far
as the rules are concerned, even though they don't overlap each other
in any normal sense of the term.  When boats are sailing downwind on
wide angles to each other, they can create very large overlap
areas. An overlap can be established or broken by turning so that the
imaginary line sweeps to a different area and no longer touches the
other boat.

A boat *finishes* when it approaches the finish line from the course
side and any part of the hull touches the finish line. It is not
necessary to _cross_ the finish line. It is important to clear away
from the course, as a boat that continues to sail the course is then
retroactively _not_ finished.



Rules
=========================================================================

The following is a simplification of the essential rules that govern
commonly arising race situations.


Safety
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Give all help to a person or vessel in danger (1.1).

- Avoid capsized/recovering, aground, and rescuing boats (22).

Right of Way
------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Examples of rule 10, port keep clear of starboard. The orange starboard boat has right of way in each. *(a)* The common upwind case. *(b)* and *(c)* with boats on different legs. *(d)* A downwind boat's tack is determined by the side its boom is on even if it is by the lee.](rules/10-starboard-port.svg)

- Different tacks:
  - Port tack keep clear of starboard (10).

- Same tack:
  - Leeward keep clear of windward when _overlapped_ (11).
  - Astern keep clear of ahead when _not overlapped_ (12).

- While tacking:
  - Keep clear of all other boats until close hauled (13).
   
- Avoid collisions (14).

- When backing a sail (21.3) or taking a penalty (21.2), keep clear of
  boats that are not.
  
- When not racing, keep clear of boats that are (23). For example,
  after finishing get out of the way of the other boats and before the
  start, keep clear of other races.

![Figure [Rule11]: Examples of rule 11, windward keep clear of leeward. The orange leeward boat has right of way in each. *(a)* and *(b)* The common upwind cases, showing overlaps in each direction. *(c)* Same tack, different legs; the boat that is sailing upwind is in the lee of the other and has right of way because neither is clear astern. *(d)* The common downwind case.](rules/11-leeward-windward.svg)

!!! Warning "Starboard!"
   Beware of the case depicted in Figure
   [Rule11]c, where boats on different legs meet on the same tack.
   Because of the way "overlap" is defined in RRS, these boats are
   considered overlapped and rule 11 applies: leeward has right of way.
   
   This can be dangerous when the blue boat sailing downwind is a
   novice racer. They may be confused about which tack the other boat
   is on, and incorrectly think "I know that I'm on starboard, so I
   must have right of way over that other boat."  Yet in this case,
   _both_ boats are on starboard, so rule 10 is irrelevant. Rule 11
   gives the orange leeward boat the right of way.
   
   If that blue boat starts bellowing "starboard!", that is a sign
   that they are confused. In practice, the orange boat could
   helpfully reply "leeward", but the rules dictate only that if
   necessary to avoid a collision it must change course (14) and
   protest (61.1).


![Examples of rule 12, astern keep clear of ahead. The orange ahead boat has right of way in each. 
  In *(b)* and *(d)*, blue only has to keep clear until it establishes an overlap. Once they are overlapped,
  rule 11 applies and right of way will switch because blue is leeward in each case.](rules/12-ahead-astern.svg)


Mark-Room
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Mark-room applies to boats _approaching_ a mark, when at least one
  of them is in the zone, and when they are either upwind on the _same
  tack_ or both sailing downwind (18.1).

- Overlap (18.2):
  - If two boats are overlapped when the first one reaches the zone,
    then the outside (relative to the mark) boat must give the inside
    boat room to round the mark even if the overlap is later broken.
  - If they are not overlapped when reaching the zone, then the astern
    boat must give room to the ahead boat even if an overlap is later
    established.
       
- Tacking (18.3): A boat that tacks inside of the zone can't force a
  windward boat above close hauled, and must give room to all inside
  overlapped boats. Tacking also causes a boat to lose its rights
  based on overlap (18.2.d).

!!! Warning Downwind Mark-Room
    Note that when sailing _downwind_, a starboard-tack boat still has
    to give room to an inside port-tack boat, and the leeward of two
    port-tack boats has to give room to the windward boat if it is inside.
    The navigation rules you've used in all other situations when sailing suddenly
    change when you hit the zone going downwind!

![Figure [Windward]: Windward example. Orange<br>is entitled to mark-room.](rules/18-windward.svg width=340px)  Because marks are typically taken to port, mark-room most commonly
applies at a windward mark only to two boats on port tack. However,
upwind gates, the finish line, and the rare explicit starboard mark
can create additional upwind cases.

In Figure [Windward], orange and blue are _approaching_ the windward mark
on the _same tack, upwind_ (port).  When blue _enters_ the zone,
orange is _overlapped_. Therefore, orange is entitled to
mark-room. Blue must keep clear even though orange is to windward. The
hails shown are not required.

![Figure [Leeward]: Leeward example. Purple is<br>entitled to mark-room from orange<br>and blue. Orange is entitled to<br>mark-room from blue.](rules/18-leeward.svg width=310px)
In Figure [Leeward], blue, orange, and purple are _approaching_ the leeward mark. When
orange _enters_ the zone, it is overlapped with each.  Purple is
entitled to mark-room from blue and orange; they must keep clear even
though purple is on port and windward. Orange is entitled to
mark-room from blue, who must keep clear even though orange is on port
and blue is on starboard.

Mark-room does not apply to the marks on the start line _during the
start_. It _does_ apply to both marks at the finish line.

Study the official text of rule 18 carefully. It is complicated and is the
rule that most commonly affects critical situations.

Technically, 18 does not "override" other rules. All rules are always
in force. By giving mark-room, a boat may necessarily break other
rules such as leeward over windward, but it is then immediately
exonerated under rule 43b for doing so and takes no penalty.


Proper Course
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- A leeward boat _that was overtaking_ can't sail above its _own
  proper course_ to slow down a give-way boat to windward _on the same
  tack_ (17). That includes not tacking late at a mark to force a
  competitor to sail wide. Note that the proper course of the windward
  boat is not relevant.
  
- An _inside and overlapped boat_ with mark room must gybe promptly
  after a (non-gate) gybe mark so as to not force give-way competitors
  to sail wide (18.4).

!!! Note When a leeward boat may luff
    The intent of rule 17 is to prevent an overtaking boat from simply
    attacking another boat on an upwind leg rather than trying to sail
    fast by itself. It generally does not apply in cases that would
    protect a faster boat from being pinched. Specifically, the
    leeward boat can head up as far as it wishes on an upwind leg, all
    of the way to luffing (but not tacking) if any of the following
    apply:
    
    - The leeward boat was _overtaken_ by the windward boat and is thus defending
    - The leeward boat established its attacking overlap more than two boat lengths away (diagonally)
    - Both boats are on starboard, and tacking to port would be the fastest and thus proper course for the leeward boat ([ruling case 46](https://sailzing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Case-46.pdf), established under previous rules)
    - Pinching or luffing would be the fastest course right at an upwind finish line -- 
      the rule refers to "proper course", not "close hauled"

    Some examples are shown #5 and #7 and [SailZing's 2021 rules tutorial](https://sailzing.com/racing-rules-of-sailing-2021-2024-rule-17-same-tack-proper-course/).


Obstructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Give other boats room to clear an obstruction following the
  same rules as you do for rounding a mark (19).
  
- If you need to _tack_ to avoid both an obstruction and
  a boat on the _same tack_, you _must_ hail the other boat to be entitled to room.
  The other boat then either tacks itself or says "you tack" 
  and gives room (20). You also must do so with enought
  time for them to respond, including them having to potentially
  hail other boats in their way.
  
- In a three-boat scenario where port-tack boat PW must stay clear of
  both port-tack boat PL to leeward and starboard-tack boat S, boat S
  counts as an obstruction and PW can request room from PL, as if at a
  mark. Because PL will also have to keep clear of S, in practice both
  port tack boats should tack or gybe in this situation.

Recall that the committee boat is a _mark_, and thus cannot be an
_obstruction_.


Start Sequence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The race starting sequence (26) is as follows:
  
  - -5 Minutes "Warning": First flag raised and one sound signal. The flag is authoritative and the sound is a courtesy.
  - -4 Minutes "Preparatory": Second flag raised and one sound signal.
  - -1 Minutes "One Minute": Second flag lowered and one long sound signal.
  - -0 Minutes "Start": First flag lowered and one sound signal.

This is the only start sequence in RRS. An individual race committee
may override it with a custom sequence. The most common override is a
three minute start for dinghy races, in which the additional time is
not useful because everyone luffs up to the line anyway.

!!! Note The organge flag
    The race committee also flies an orange flag from the boat
    on the start line and a blue flag from the boat on the finish line (5.2).
    Do not confuse this with the start sequence flags. There will
    be _three_ total flags raised at two minutes before the start. 

Most committees will use an optional rapid sequence of sound signals
before the five minute Warning, to get everyone's attention that the sequence
is about to begin.

At least five minutes before the five minute warning, the orange flag
will be raised with a sound signal. In practice, the committee often
raises this flag as soon as they anchor and forgets the sound signal.
The orange flag is the end of the start line (and the blue flag is the
end of the finish line), not the committee boat that flies it.


Propulsion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use only the wind, waves, and current to change and maintain speed (42.1).

- Specifically, do not (42.2):
   - Pump the sail (42.2a).
   - Rock the boat (42.2b).
   - Jump forward, ooching  (42.2c).
   - Scull with the rudder (42.2d).
   - Repeatedly tack or gybe for no tactical reason (42.2e).

- Except (42.3):
   - Rolling to steer (42.3a).
   - Rolling to preserve speed (but not accelerate further) during a
     tack or gybe (42.3b).
   - Pumping the sail _once_ per wave or gust to initiate planing
     (42.3c).
   - Sculling when in irons (42.3d).
   - Pumping to fix an inverted batten, as long as it does not clearly
     propel the boat (42.3e).
   - Swinging the rudder to _slow down_ (42.3f).

- Anchoring to maintain position is allowed, so long as the boat does
  not gain ground by doing so (i.e., no kedging).

!!! Note The Right to Swim 
   I find it very charming that swimming is explicitly permitted during
   a race (48.2). You have to get back in the boat before it sails
   for the next mark, of course. It is probably stated to avoid
   penalizing capsized dinghy sailors, but I also like to swim on hot
   days while waiting for the race start.


Penalties and Protests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Starting too early: turn and sail until the hull is completely
  behind the starting line, and then start again, keeping clear of all
  other boats that started correctly (30). _This is the default.
  However, if the black, U, or I flags are flying there are severe
  penalties for being on the course side of the line before the start._

- Right of way violations: 720 degrees turn (two complete turns, two
  tacks, two gybes; Part 2).

- Any equipment touching a mark on the current leg: 360 degrees turn
  of one tack and one gybe (31).

- Marks only affect the current leg being sailed (28) and can
  otherwise be ignored, including which side they are passed on and
  hitting them.

- To protest, hail with the word "protest." If on a boat 6m / 19.7ft
  or longer, then also display a red flag (61.1). The protest is
  invalid if both actions are not done. Saying _why_ you are
  protesting is helpful, especially in more casual club racing, but is
  not required.

- "If the boat caused injury or serious damage or, despite taking a
  penalty, gained a significant advantage in the race or series by her
  breach her penalty shall be to retire." (44.1)


When you have been protested, there is no need to respond to the other
boat. You have exactly three options:

- Take the penalty turns immediately, which exonerates you.
- Wait for a hearing and risk disqualification if the committee rules
  against you.
- Retire from the race.

In friendly club races, it is not uncommon to discuss the situation
briefly at the time or on shore afterwards. In that case, everyone is
seeking to learn and understand the rules--and remain on good terms with
their clubmates.


Courses
=========================================================================

The course is chosen by the race committee and communicated ahead of
time to the skippers at the meeting. It may also be changed on the
water or during the race if the conditions change.

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The diagram below shows a typical course. The start/finish line
is perpendicular to the wind. It is denoted by the committee boat
on the starboard end and the pin buoy on the port end. All marks
except for the committee boat must be taken on the port side of
the boat.

![A triangle course, showing a possible path that the blue boat might take around it. Not to scale.](triangle-detail.svg width=75%)

The blue boat chooses to start on starboard tack, so that it has right
of way over any port tack boats. It sails close hauled on the first
*upwind leg* (aka beating leg, beat), and rounds the *windward mark*
on starboard tack. It then falls off to a broad reach after it rounds
the mark and heads for the *offset mark* (aka gybe mark).  At the
offset mark, it gybes onto a port tack broad reach and sails for the
*leeward mark*. At the leeward mark, it rounds up hard to close hauled
and sails for the finish line. It tacks and then sails to the
finish. After finishing, the boat will keep clear of others still
sailing the course and wait for the next race to begin.

The blue boat could have chosen to start on port tack, and to start or
finish at different points along the line. It could have tacked at
different locations and more times on the two upwind legs. It does not
have much freedom on the broad reaches, where it must sail its proper
course that is straight towards the marks. At each mark, it must round
promptly after passing and not overextend its turns.

Common
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix S of RRS defines some standard courses as examples of racing
instructions. In my experience, those courses are rarely used for
club or college races, however. The following are the more common
courses I've encountered.

In each, the black line depictings the direction
of travel but not the exact path of boats. The wind is coming from the
top in each diagram.

![Triangle](triangle.svg height=200) ![Windward Leeward](wl.svg height=200) ![Triangle Windward Leeward](twl.svg height=200)
![Windward Leeward,<br>Twice Around](wl2.svg height=200) ![Windward Leeward,<br>Downwind Finish](wld.svg height=200) ![Variant Windward Leeward,<br>Downwind Finish](wld-alt.svg height=200)
![Olympic Triangle](olympic.svg height=200) ![Olympic Trapezoid](trapezoid.svg height=200)

The Olympic Trapezoid shown here has a gate. At the green marks,
boats may choose either the port or starboard side. If taking
the starboard side mark, a boat sails the gray stroked third leg.
If it takes the port side mark, it sails the black stroked third leg.

A club may have a specific set of named courses with abbreviations
that it uses as variations on these.

*Windward Leeward* is sometimes referred to casually as a *sausage*,
and Triangle Windward Leeward could also be called Triangle Sausage.

Actual Olympic sailing uses many courses including variations on the
Olympic Triangle and Olympic Trapezoid, and in club races, there are
several variations on what is _called_ an Olympic course.

Protests
=========================================================================

Boats are expected to voluntarily obey the rules and to enforce them
on others. In sailboat racing, if you make a mistake, you must take
the penalty regardless of whether anyone sees your infraction or
complains about it. Because of this, it is also the case that except
for the start and finish, it is not generally the race committee's job
to enforce the rules. This is in contrast to many other sports in
which rules are externally enforced on competitors by umpires or
referees. That is something I find both pragmatic and charming.

A *protest* is a formal way of notifying another boat that they have
broken a rule. This usually happens because they were unaware of
exactly what happened, not because they were trying to cheat and got
caught. In some complicated situations, boats are also required to
protest for the penalty to be mandated.

Depending on the style of racing and the gravity of the infraction, a
protest and response may vary. Dinghies simply hail with the word
"protest" and perhaps the rule number or explanation.  That tells the
other boat to take penalty turns on the water. Larger boats also fly a
protest flag. The race committee may technically protest a boat as
well, although rarely does.  If the protested boat did not take
penalty turns, that can trigger formal hearing on shore after the race
that resembles a legal proceeding. The protest committee hears
evidence from witnesses and rules arguments, and may then assign
time adjustments or disqualify a boat from the race.

When you first begin racing, it is a good idea to not protest
anyone. It is wise to wait until you understand the rules and the
etiquite of your particular racing venue. Of course, if someone
protests _you_, do not argue. Just take the penalty regardless of
whether you understand the problem or think that you were in the
right.

As you become familiar with the right of way rules and understand the
level of experience of the other boats on the water, it is appropriate
to protest if another boat who you believe should know what they are doing
fouls you by violating the rules. 

Be careful, however. There are a lot of subtleties to when various
exceptions apply. A port boat not keeping clear of a starboard one
when there are no marks, obstructions, or other boats about is usually
pretty clear. If the situation is complicated and you're still
relatively new to the rules, then don't be too quick to complain.
Consider whether the other boat might have a far more experienced
skipper who is taking advantage of a rule interaction that you are
unaware of.


Race Types
=========================================================================

![2022 Sydney-Hobart Race start.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/77th_Rolex_Sydney_Hobart_Yacht_Race_at_16_minutes_in.jpg attrib="CC BY-SA 4.0 Dicklyon")

Races are categorized as:

- *One-design* races in production boats, where all boats are
  identical.
- *Mixed-class* production boat club races, where Portsmouth (dinghy) and PHRF
  (keelboat) handicaps are applied to well known boat classes for fairness by adjusting the
  *time* sailed. Sometimes the time is preadjusted based on the length
  of the course and start times are staggered, so that the first boat
  to finish will win.
- *Mixed-design* offshore yacht races using [ORC](https://orc.org/), 
  [ORR](https://www.offshoreracingrule.org/), and 
  [IRC](https://ircrating.org/) measurement based handicaps.
- *Design-rule* races in custom boats, where an equation for boat
  metrics and set of training rules gives creative design freedom
  while governing overall fairness.

The diversity of sailboat races includes:

- [College varsity dinghies](https://www.collegesailing.org/), typically 20 minute races
  with ten to forty single- or double-handed boats organized in weekend regattas
- One design national, regional, and world regattas (e.g., [ILCA](https://sailing.laserinternational.org/site/event-list),
  [420](https://420sailing.org/content/420-world-championships), [RS200](https://www.rs200sailing.org/), 
  [49er](https://49er.org/event/2022-world-championship/))
- Offshore and cross-ocean races, which are typically multi-day and on large keelboats or catamarans.
  Fatigue is a major factor. The largest of these include
  the [Fastnet](https://www.rolexfastnetrace.com/en/), [Sydney-Hobart](https://rolexsydneyhobart.com/),
  [Newport-Bermuda](https://bermudarace.com/), 
  [Transpac](https://transpacyc.com/), 
  [Route du Rhum](https://www.routedurhum.com/en),
  [Transat](https://www.thetransat.com/the-race) and
  [Mini Transat](https://minitransat.fr/),
  and [The Ocean (aka Volvo, Whitbread)](https://www.theoceanrace.com/).
- [America's Cup](https://www.americascup.com/), which today is a set of match races between
  design-rule boats fielded by nations
- [SailGP](https://sailgp.com/), similar to formula one car racing for foiling catamarans
- Around the world races (e.g., [Clipper](https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/),
  [Golden Globe](https://goldengloberace.com/),
  [Vendée Globe](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/),
  [Barcelona](https://www.barcelonaworldrace.org/en/)), where
  weather forecasting, navigation, maintenance underway, and endurance
  are core parts of the challenge and the race may take months to years 
  to complete!
  

Because the absolute time does not matter in most scoring, sailing
_fast_ is not as important as sailing _faster_ than the
competition. This means that a large part of strategy in a sailboat
race is creating situations in which the rules favor one's own
boat and prevent competitors from gaining ground or passing.

Some scoring variations beyond first-across-the-line can create more
complex strategic goals:

- *Handicap* (PHRF, Portsmouth) races are won based on *adjusted time* (AT) instead of
  *course time* (CT) finishes. A fast boat that will have to "give time"
  needs to avoid battling individual other fast competitors. Instead, it
  must focus on minimizing its total time relative to slower boats that
  it has no way of directly fighting.
- *Pursuit* races are a variation on handicap races. Each boat is assigned
  a start time based on its handicap. The first across the line wins,
  because the time adjustment was preapplied. This essentially shifts the
  end time adjustment to the start time. Ideally this would increase the
  amount of interaction and excitement at the end of the race, while
  reducing interaction at the congested start.
- *Match* races have only two boats facing off head-to-head.
- *Team racing* is scored by the finish positions of a set of boats
  that sail together as a team. Instead of individually sailing to
  finish first, they collaborate to slow competitors and ensure that
  their fleet's set of finish positions is collectively higher than
  their opponents'.
- A *regatta* is a set of races in which the winner has the best
  total across the sum of their individual race scores. This can change
  a boat's best strategy in an individual race to not be finishing
  first. Instead, preventing a close-ranked competitor from 
  placing well may lead to the best total result.
- A *series* is like a regatta, but takes place over a long period of
  time, often an entire season. Because of the long time period,
  not all boats may be able to participate in all races. A common
  rule is that each boat scores one point for every other boat that
  it beats in a race. A boat's series score is the sum of their race
  scores. So, participating and performing well in the individual
  races in which many others participate is more important than
  attending every race.

can be used when a race committee and committee boat are not
available.

Improving
===============================================================

I find that racing is a terrific way to improve one's skills at
sailing. Once you're focused on a goal and have less time to overthink
individual maneuvers, the skills start to become internalized and
intuitive.

Racing in conditions or with competitors who are far outside of your
abilities is not helpful. However, sailing at the edge of your comfort
zone and with some competitors who are just a bit better is a great
way to drive yourself to improve.

Outside of a race itself, some ways that you can improve your racing
skills are:

- Study the rules. There are plenty of videos and articles 
  analyzing situations both common and obscure.
- Sail in varying conditions as if compelled by a race, and not just
  in mild wind and on sunny days. Take on a little more or less wind than is
  ideal for you. Sail on cold or very hot days. Sail in the rain (but
  not thunderstorms).
- Rig and dress as if you were racing when sailing for practice. Have your watch,
  your helmet, your big sail, etc. as if it were a race.
  This will help you become accustomed to them and resolve any gear issues
  outside of competition.
- Practice all points of sail. Sail upwind as close to the wind as you
  can, sail reaches and deep reaches, make gybes to close hauled as if rounding a
  mark, etc.
- Practice race maneuvers as if doing drills--you are a self-coached
  athlete! Perform repeated back-to-back tacks for 15 minutes straight.
  Practice repeated gybes. Practice your penalty 720 degree and 360 degree
  turns. Practice bearing off at the start to accelerate and then
  heading up hard. 
- If you're in a dinghy, practice backwinding to pause at the start
  and _practice capsize recovery_. You are far more likely to capsize
  during a race than day sailing as you push your limits. When you
  capsize in a race, a fast recovery can preserve your place.
