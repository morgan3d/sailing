                **Essential Rope Handling for Boats**
              Published 2022-12-23; Last updated 2023-04-01


This article describes the essential knots and other rope handling
techniques for recreational boating. Despite the common perception,
you really do not need to know how to tie many knots to begin to
contribute effectively on a boat. That even includes not even
needing the famous bowline knot at first!

Working ropes are called "*lines*" on a boat.  Surprisingly, the most
useful line handling skills are ones that many experienced sailors
still perform incorrectly: (dock) *cleating*, *coiling three-strand
mooring lines*, and *coiling braided lines*. You can level up your
nautical expertise and be a great asset on board any boat by learning
to perform these two properly. They are guaranteed to arise on every
outing. They are also something the skipper is often not able to do
personally while at the helm, and so appreciates the help with.

Once you can perform coiling and cleating, learn to tie on fenders 
with a round turn and two half hitches. This is something that also
arises every outing on larger boats. The skipper can do it themselves,
but it is a big help to have others able to.

If on a sail boat, proper use of *manual winches* and *clutches* is next.
Finally, add a few key knots and other techniques. The set of skills
for everyday boating is surprisingly small. In this article, I call
out the minimal set of line handling skills that are sufficient to
take you through years of boating and intermediate level sailing in
particular.

Of course, interesting knots and other rope techniques are themselves
a fascinating subject. There is no reason to stop at only the
essentials if you find this topic interesting.


The Techniques
=====================================================================

Below are the basic line handling skills for boating. I prioritize
mastering them in this order, based on how helpful they are to have
crew know. 

For example, you're going to operate a winch at least ten or twenty
times a day on a mid-sided sailboat. So, that is a high priority to
learn. 

In contrast, you will likely only tie at most two bowline knots
that day before leaving the dock, and the skipper could do that
themselves. In practice, those bowlines were probably tied once when the jib
was purchased and never untied afterwards. Of course, you'll still need to know to tie the bowlines if you _are_
the skipper, so the stopper still makes the essentials list near at
the bottom.


[Cleating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU)
: ![ ](cleat.jpg attrib="Annapolis Performance Sailing" attrib-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBqsF72xNSU" width=200px) Needed for docking, and some halyards and outhauls. 
  Always begin around the _far_ cleat horn relative to the working end.
  For docking, make one or more _full_ wraps
  at the base depending on the relative size of the line and cleat.
  Finish with the locking hitch or a full wrap (making an "OXO"), 
  depending on the relative risks of binding vs. slipping.
  For halyards and outhauls the initial full wrap is not needed.
  
  Some people do not make the initial full wrap for docking when
  doing so for a short time. I always anticipate that I might be docked
  or away from the boat longer than expected and make the full wrap.
  Half a second while cleating is a small tradeoff to eliminate the risk
  of a dockline coming loose!

[Coiling three-strand lines](https://youtu.be/6B7ImYv88qQ)
: Unlike covered, braided lines, three-strand lines can be coiled in a
  circle instead of figure 8s. This is because they already have a
  twist built in to them. (They are also used exclusively for mooring
  and towing, so aren't run through blocks when in use).
  
  Bring the line from one hand to another, laying it flat to make big
  circles that lie against each other. Do not coil around your elbow.
  Wet mooring lines are best stowed either 
  hanging in a locker or simply [looped over a rail](https://youtu.be/LNav2agjHrA?t=47).
  Dry mooring lines can be stowed with a coil and crown in a locker.
  
  The figure 8 method can be used for three-strand lines as well.

[Coiling a covered line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4Zr0vdGHE&t=189s)
: ![ ](coil.jpg width=200px) Needed for storing cover-and-core,
  braided running rigging lines on a sailboat, such as halyards and
  sheets. Some boats also use covered lines for mooring. The linked
  video shows the figure 8 coil, which I find easiest to teach and
  perform reliably.
  
  There are two other methods for achieving the same outcome via twists. 
  These are [twisting each coils alternating directions](https://www.animatedknots.com/coil-unattached-rope-knot), 
  and [twisting the line as the coil comes in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TV9cnzI3E).
  The catch is that if you get the twists wrong it is much easier to make a mistake
  with these methods, and then the line will not run freely through blocks
  when it is later used.
  
  For a fixed line, start from the working (attached) end and coil
  towards the bitter (free) end so that twists work their way out. If there
  is a winch nearby, that can be used as a tool [to explicitly make the figure 8s](https://youtu.be/2333Ff8GJDw?t=448),
  which is a very fast method.



[Round turn and two half hitches](https://eoceanic.com/sailing/tips/16/135/a_very_useful_general_purpose_knot_the_round_turn_and_two_half_hitches/) (RT2HH)
: ![ ](rt2hh.png alt="CC SA 3.0 from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roringstek.png" width=200px) For tying
  fenders to a lifeline, docking to a post or ring, attaching an
  anchor to the rode, and fastening anything to a pole, bar, or
  ring. Prefer it to a bowline when you have to tie or release under
  tension, or need a tight wrap.
  This knot is just a full wrap plus a clove hitch. It can be finished
  with extra half hitches to further prevent slipping or take up extra 
  line on the working end.

[Winch operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaC8V8ecdpw) 
: ![ ](winch.jpg attrib="Image by George Hodan, CC0" attrib-url="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/es/view-image.php?image=434883" width=200px) Needed for tensioning halyards, sheets, and outhauls. This is only 
  essential for keelboats, as powerboats and dinghies don't have these
  kinds of winches. Proper winch operation is as much about not injuring
  your hands or back as treating the boat well.
  
 
[Throwing a line](https://www.boatus.com/expert-advice/expert-advice-archive/2014/june/how-to-throw-a-line-properly)
: This is how to get a line to someone on another boat or a dock
  without it going in the water or hitting them in the face. The key
  points are:
  
   1. Throw about half of the coils and let the other half run out.
   2. Aim for the catcher's outstretched arm on the side, not their face and body.
   3. Aim for a point well past the target when throwing a dry line. It is lighter
      than you might expect.

[Flemish coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsKcGFx1c8)
: ![ ](flemish-coil.jpg width=200px attrib="&copy; Leo Reynolds, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0" attrib-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/8692344636") Needed for storing mooring line tails on a dock.
  Start the coil flat on the dock at the center, and just keep it flat and spin the entire coil around until
  it has consumed all of the line. Do not wrap the line around a fixed coil.

[Rolling hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVOR9lOaEQg)
: a.k.a. Magnus Hitch. Needed for anchor snubbers and clearing a jammed winch, and can also
  be used to attach objects to vertical poles. This hitch slips in one
  direction for adjustment, grabs in the other for working. It must be
  tied in a line parallel to the line or bar parallel to the one that
  is under tension. 
  
  The wraps go around both the target and the line, binding them
  together towards the anchor or other source of tension in the
  target. The final half hitch is then on the other side of the
  standing part, closer to the source of tension in the target. When
  tied correctly, the knot looks like a hand holding the line, where
  the wraps are fingers and the running end is the thumb sticking out
  towards the source of tension in the target.
  
  When tying to a pole with an object on the line, it looks like a
  hand pulling itself up. When tying from a line overhead to _hold_ a
  pole, it looks like a hand reaching down from above.

[Trucker's hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raTYwsfnsXg)
: This uses a rolling hitch and a slip knot, and can be doubled up for
  increased purchase. It is needed for attaching a small boat to a
  trailer or roof rack, tying down a boat cover, and rigging jack
  lines.

[Bowline](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot)
: ![ ](bowline.jpg width=200px attrib="&copy; Clint Budd, CC BY 2.0"
  attrib-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/58827557@N06/51521719787")Needed
  for attaching sheets to a sail clew, tying on a dinghy painter,
  tying to a mooring ball, attaching a boom gybe preventer, tying
  around a person or as a foot loop for a rescue, and generally is the
  go-to (and arguably overused) sailing knot.
  
  This is confusingly _not_ the way to attach the mooring line to the bow
  or the dock. 
  
  The largest drawbacks of the bowline are that it cannot be tied under
  tension and can work loose if tension is not maintained.

[Figure 8](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) (Flemish knot)
: Stopper knot that is easily untied, good for the ends of jib/genoa sheets,
  the mainsheet, or a small boat's vang. Spinnaker sheets [do not use stopper knots](https://www.quantumsails.com/en/resources-and-expertise/articles/three-common-spinnaker-mishaps-and-how-to-fix-them).

[Double overhand](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-overhand-stopper-knot)
: Stopper knot that is more permanent than a figure 8. Good for
  halyards as a stopper at the bottom, or for stopping the
  ball at the top of a dinghy halyard.
 
[Dinghy halyard ball attachment](halyard-ball.png)
: A ball passed through a loop has replaced the traditional
  [studding sail halyard bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukxwS8RrJxg)
  for the sail end of dinghy halyards.  It saves a few centimeters at
  the top of the halyard and is and easier to tie and untie,
  especially with cold, wet hands in gloves.

Key points to know about knots:

- Knots weaken lines by as much as 50%. The line will break at the
  knot, not in the middle of the tensioned line. For strength,
  permanent attachments are spliced in lines or sewn in webbing
  instead of tied. Existing loops are
  [best linked](https://www.animatedknots.com/girth-hitch-knot) by
  shackles instead of knots.
- Tying more knots in a line rarely makes a better hold, and
  definitely makes it harder to untie. The exception is that
  some knots in slipperier ropes benefit from finishing with
  a few half hitches.
- Modern synthetic lines do not hold knots as well as traditional
  lines. Most knots will [slip easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7gI4YF0D2Y) in something like an unsleeved
  dyneema/spectra line. Even modern three-braid and sleeved
  lines have much less friction than tarred hemp, so beware
  of knot information that is more than 20 years old.


Vocabulary
=====================================================================

Some general rope vocabulary, mostly for fun because this isn't
essential in practice:

[Working end](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The free end of a line used to tie a knot.

[Standing part](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: The part of the line attached to something else, so not available
  to manipulate for tying a knot.
  
[Bight](https://www.netknots.com/rope_knots/rope-knot-terms)
: Some part of the middle of a rope. This is used when referring to
  tying a knot "on a bight", meaning without a working end available.

Lazy line
: A line that is not currently in use or under tension because some
  partner rope on the other side is under tension. Frequently
  used for the sheets, the lines attached to the jib sail, and running
  backstays, which are lines that support and tension the mast.

Working line
: A line that is under tension.

[Bitter end](https://www.grammar-monster.com/sayings_proverbs/bitter_end.htm)
: The end of the anchor line that is tied to the boat.

Sleeve
: The woven covering providing UV protection and friction on a modern line.

Core
: The interior of a modern line, which provides the strength.

I cover the names of specific lines for sailing and mooring in my
other guides. They aren't "essential", either. In cases where you need
to know that, you're with someone and they will clarify, such as "the
big red rope on the left side of the boat"; you are by yourself and
don't need to know the name; or you are reading and have time to look
it up.


Next Steps
=====================================================================

This guide for rope essentials is of course only the beginning of rope
techniques employed on boats, although it covers 99% of daily
use. There's a wonderful world of knots for all kinds of line and
purposes to learn after these. 

I use maybe another ten knots occasionally for specific purposes,
including the
[slip knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxnkth1n_2A),
[double fisherman bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot),
[halyard hitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEEYkfINomY),
[cow hitch/lark's head](https://www.animatedknots.com/cow-hitch-knot-end-method),
[sheet bend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MITXMnu8jo8)/double sheet bend, and
[reef (square) knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_iorha2k4). 

Line maintenance skills such as 
[splicing](https://www.animatedknots.com/short-splice-knot), 
[eye splicing](https://www.animatedknots.com/eye-splice-knot), 
[fusing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4yhe3Hbno),
and [whipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCXhdzvQrU) are essential for boat maintenance and likely more
important than learning most esoteric knots, which are of more
aesthetic and historical interest than practical use.

If you _must_ tie knots in unsleeved dyneema/spectra, two knots
that Evans Starzinger developed and recommends are:

- [EStar Hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/images/estar_hitch.gif)
- [EStar Stopper](https://www.animatedknots.com/estar-stopper-knot)

These can still slip, though--prefer splicing.

Some interesting sources for going down the rabbit hole on
knots are:

- [Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com/)
- [The Ashley Book of Knots](https://www.liendoanaulac.org/space/references/training/Ashley_Book_Knots.pdf)
- [International Guild of Knot Tyers Forum](https://forum.igkt.net/index.php)

Beware that all of them have information that may sound authoritative
but in practice not be fully accurate for your exact situation, type
of line, or application.
