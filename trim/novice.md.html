                       **Novice Sail Trimming**
                 Published 2023-06-03; Updated 2023-06-03

This sail trim guide is for novice sailors in less than 15 knots of wind. 

As a skipper, novice means that you're comfortable sailing
a dinghy or small keelboat on your own as described in the
[10 Easy Steps](../beginner/index.md.html) guide and are familiar with the
[Essential Rope Techniques](../rope/index.md.html). Now, you want to
improve your sail handling beyond intuition for more speed and control.

As crew, novice means that you are comfortable on the boat and engaged
as an active participant, having been briefed by your skipper on
terminology and expectations. That could be as soon as your first day
on a boat, or take a few trips to build the comfort level. For crew,
this guide is good for moving beyond blindly following the skipper's
instructions to have autonomy and understanding in sail adjustment.

If already you've mastered the techniques in this article, then my
[intermediate trimming](intermediate.html) guide may be more appropriate.

There's a lot more to effective sailing than sail handling. Steering,
navigation, ballast management, mooring, rig adjustment, race
strategy, and boat maintenance are all key skills. However, if you're
day sailing in a small boat, or crewing for someone else, then sail
handling is one of the first skills you'll want independent ability
in.

Look at the Sail
====================================================================

*Look at the sail* while sailing. That's how you know when it needs to
be adjusted and learn how it reacts to different conditions. 

For performance sailing, in the course of two minutes I'll spend 60-90
seconds looking at the sail; 15 seconds looking at other boats, the
horizon, and water; and only the remainder checking on systems and
people in the boat. I only look at lines to verify that they are
untangled, cleated or uncleated properly, and not chafing.

*Look at the sail* when adjusting it. Do not look at the control line
or other boats while adjusting a sail. The main feedback all comes
from the sail. This includes while raising a sail with a halyard.

(There are a few exceptions for experienced sailors who are racing.
In a dinghy, they can feel the impact of their adjustments and will
depend more on feel to maintain situational awareness in close
quarters at a start line or mark rounding. For very large adjustments,
including changing points of sail and switching to a spinnaker, marks
on lines help expert racers consistently hit their same base trim
before making fine adjustments. By definition, none of this applies to
novices, but it is something to look forward to!)


Sheet Trim
=====================================================================

Angle of Attack
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When sailing with the wind coming from front or mostly beside the
boat, the sail acts as a vertical airfoil. Adjust the sail's *angle of
attack* using the sheet until the sail is about 5 degrees trimmed in
from the barely luffing point. Most new sailors overtrim, especially
when sailing upwind and heeling. Just ease the sail until the luff
point and then bring it back a bit.

When the wind is coming from behind the boat, the sail is a big drag
parachute. Downwind, ease the sheet to catch as much wind as
possible. The jib does very little downwind, which is why more
experienced sailors may fly a spinnaker.

Bits of string or ribbon called *telltales* that are taped to the
sails can help be an early warning system for trim adjustments. On a
well trimmed sail, both the inside and outside telltales will stream
backwards (if there is enough wind). If one of them "breaks" and is
down or flying backwards, move the sail in the direction of the broken
telltale.

Grip
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Always hold a sheet like a microphone, with the working end towards
the sail coming out of your fist by your pinkie and the tail end
coming out by your thumb. This lets you use your bicep to do most of
the work (instead of lower back) and gives a large range of motion. It
also avoids the risk of index finger and thumb being caught in a block
or winch.

Try to hold the a sheet with just enough pressure that it does not
slip from your hand. (The same advice applies to a tiller or wheel.)
A tight deathgrip is fatiguing, but also reduces your ability to sense
a change in pressure that is valuable feedback.

Never wrap a sheet around your hand to get more purchase. It can be
hard to release in a dangerous situation, and risks rope burn, and can
pull your hand into a dangerous position or trap you if falling
overboard.

Consider wearing fingerless sailing or biking gloves to reduce chafing 
on your hand and improve grip when wet.

Keep your hand well back from a cleat, winch, or block. Especially
when releasing a cleat, the line can jump forward significantly.

A *cam cleat* has two rotating jaws that the line is pulled down (or
for some mainsheets, up) between to lock in place. These are
frequently used to reduce the strain and free up a hand for a sailor
on sheets.  When releasing, you must both pull in and up (or down)
from the cleat.  This can be difficult when sitting on the
rail/gunnel. With a little practices, you can learn to flick slack in
the line down so that it releases when it hits the cleat and does not
require leaning in over the cleat.

For more information about winch operation and preparing sheets, see the
[rope skills guide](../rope/index.md.html).


Other Controls
=====================================================================
I discuss more sail controls for shape in the the
[intermediate](intermediate.md.html) sail trim article. These controls are
essential for high performance and stronger wind conditions, but can
be neglected as a novice focusing on the sheets. For a novice level,
reasonable settings and amount of understanding are as follows.

The *cunningham* (mainsail downhaul) adjusts luff (front edge) tension.
Leave it off in light wind and progressively tighten it for stronger
wind to help the boat point higher upwind.
  
The *halyard* also adjusts luff tension, and is used in the absence
of a cunningham. Raise your halyard all of the way on any sails as a
novice.  Be careful to not overtension once the sail is at the top;
you're just straining the part of the line after the top block and
potentially jamming your sail at that point.

The *vang* adjusts leech (back edge) tension and flattens the mainsail
to reduce power in higher wind. Keep it only just tighter than
sagging to prevent the boom from riding up in gusts and provide some
shape upwind, and tighten more upwind in strong conditions. 

The *outhaul* adjusts foot (bottom edge) tension and flattens the mainsail.
In a keelboat, bring it back to the marked line. In a dinghy, seek
about 20cm of space between the mainsail and boom when upwind.
Loosen in light wind and when sailing downwind. Tighten to 10cm in stronger
wind, but do not flatten all of the way or you won't have good acceleration
and control upwind.
  
The *traveler* allows independent control of the angle of attack and
leech tension with the mainsheet. Leave it centered as a novice.
  
*Jib cars* control the leech of the jib upwind. Leave them centered
as a novice, although bring them forward when reefing (which is not
really a novice situation!)
  
*Leech lines* control the leech of the sails and are typically set
just after raising sails. They are also convenient for helping keep
shape in older sails.  Ignore them as a novice and just ensure that
they aren't loose and able to catch in anything.
  
*Stay tension* and *mast rake* are very advanced controls. If your
boat has stays, have someone else adjust these for you once to a
level that is safe for the rig, and then ignore them until you've
mastered the other elements. The exceptions are dinghy forestays
(which in a boat like a 420 is the wire through the jib luff, not
the wire used to retain the mast on shore). In many boats these must
be set every time it is sailed. Refer to the manual and trim guide
for your boat to determine appropriate tension in this case.


If you want to begin experimenting more, start with the traveler as it
is the easiest control to understand. The traveler lets you separate
the downward and inward pull of the mainsheet when sailing
upwind. Adjust it to keep the mainsheet roughly vertical until it goes
beyond the traveler track, at which point the traveler will be
released nearly to the end on that side. Avoid pulling the traveler
past halfway when close hauled.


Changing Tacks
===============================================================

Tacking
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from close hauled on one tack through head to
wind to close hauled on another tack, the sail switches sides after
luffing and the maneuver is called *tacking*. 

Tacking is potentially
difficult to achieve if there is very strong or very light wind, in
which case the boat may not make it through the tack and can become
stuck in irons. It is generally considered safe because the sail
naturally loses power in the middle of the maneuver, so the forces
are minimized and easy to control. 

To avoid being stuck in irons when tacking, tack decisively with some
speed on. Move the rudder significantly and hold it in place until the
boat is accelerating on the new tack. In general, a boat loses
significant speed during a tack.

Gybing
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from running on one tack to running on the other
tack, that is called a *gybe* (also spelled "jibe"). The sail never
luffs in this case. It is powered on one side and then suddenly
powered on the other side. 

Gybing is easy to accomplish because there is never any loss of
power. In fact, it is too easy. It is potentially dangerous because
there is never a natural reduction of force and the sail and boom can
come across the boat very fast and when the crew is unprepared.

To maintain control during a gybe, bring the mainsail into the center
of the boat just before turning the rudder. Then, ease it back out on
the new side, rather than letting it crash on its own. In light wind,
you can instead grab the mainsheet directly on the way to the boom and
move it from one side to the other to force the sail to gybe. When
gybing, the boat generally maintains speed.

Avoid a surprising crash gybe through vigilance when sailing downwind.
Attend to incoming changes of wind direction and continuously watch
the back edge of the sail to see if it is curling and about to move.
In very strong and changeable winds, avoid sailing directly downwind
entirely.

Fearless Gybes
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no need to be afraid of gybing. Once you know how to depower
the mainsail using the sheet, vang, and cunningham you will always
be in control of your boat. Leverage that control to bring the main
across intentionally by throwing it in light wind and centering it
in heavy wind. 

In a small boat, if the conditions make you afraid to gybe then you
should return to shore. The maneuver should never be uncontrolled and
thus hard and dangerous. If it isn't safe to gybe, then it isn't safe
to sail. (Moreover, I've sailed many boats that are hard to tack in
high wind, so I _prefer_ to gybe to reverse direction in a small boat
in high wind to maintain speed and control. I will often do so near
the starting line in a race where losing speed or going into irons
would be catastrophic.)

If you're concerned about gybing in a large boat, that is a sign that
you need to reduced sail by reefing. Only in storm conditions with
exceptional wind and strong waves should it be necessary to fall back
on a "chicken gybe" by tacking around 270 degrees instead of gybing.


Wind
====================================================================

True Wind
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind in the absence of a boat is the *true wind*, as distinguished
by the apparent wind that the boat perceives in its own reference frame.

Wind is described by the direction it comes _from_. An East wind blows
from East to West. If it is a due East wind, then facing at 90 degrees
on a compass is facing into the wind.

Wind speed is measured in knots, abbreviated kt or kts. 1 knot is one
nautical mile per hour, where a nautical mile is one degree of
lattitude or about 1/24000 the circumference of the Earth.

10 kts is about 11.5 mph and 18.5 kph. So, the speed in knots is
slightly higher than in mph and a little less than double the speed in
kph. This is important to know because your forecast may be in
different units.

The power of wind rises with the cube of wind speed. For example, the
difference between 5 and 10 kts is about the same as the difference
between 20 and 21 kts. This means that the exact wind speed is more
important to attend to in strong conditions.

Apparent Wind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A moving boat experiences *apparent wind*. Because the boat is moving,
the wind always seems to be coming from a direction slightly more
rotated towards the boat's own course. When sailing upwind, this makes
the wind seem stronger, and when sailing downwind it makes it seem
weaker.  The presence of headsails also redirects the wind experienced
by the mainsail.

There are two important and common implications of apparent wind.
First, as a boat accelerates upwind or on a reach, the sails must be
adjusted (by trimming them in) to account for the new relative
direction of the wind. Second, it is easy to underestimate the wind
strength when sailing downwind. Sailors must be aware of this in 
moderate to high wind to stay within a safe and controllable margin
downwind, and also to avoid being surprised when later turning upwind.
  
There are also some interesting uncommon implications for very high
performance boats such as racing catmarans and foilers. These include
limitations on downwind sailing speed and effectively sailing upwind
when on a deep reach relative to the true wind.


Variation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wind is not constant. It changes direction and strength continuously
throughout the day in predictable ways, and *shifts* on a scale of
every few minutes in many areas in unpredictable ways. If there are
large landforms or buildings--or other boats--nearby, they will also
block or redirect wind. 

Wind is created by temperature and pressure differences. Near the
surface it is slowed by land features such as trees and hills, and
funneled to greater strength by large features such as rows of
buildings and mountain passes. Over large flat farmland or meadows,
and large bodies of water, it proceeds unimpeded and can build to
greater strength.

Good sailors always look at a forecast before sailing to know the
approximate conditions and _general way that they will change while sailing_. Then,
while sailing, they continuously attend to wind strength, direction,
and incoming weather visible in the sky.  

You can tell which way the wind is blowing by looking at flags, loose
hair, windvanes, and trees. If you are ever very confused, simply ease
your mainsheet and the front of the boom will point into the
wind. Many boats have a wind indicator (windvane) on the top of the
mast, or pieces of yarn tied to the stays to help visualize the local
wind direction.

Look for signs of small changes in the wind strength and
direction. You can see these by watching the movement of dark patches
on the surface of the water, as well as by watching other
sailboats. The patches are easier to notice when wearing polarized
sunglasses that cut the glare. If there is a large glassy patch of
water, that is smooth and has little wind. If sailing near buildings
or cliffs, beware of ways that wind may bend significantly near them.

A *gust* of wind is a sudden, short-lived increase in wind strength.
It often comes from a different direction than the average wind.
A *puff* is a small gust, shorter and weaker. A *lull* is a time
where the wind is reduced. A *hole* is the area where the lull
is occuring. To sail fast, link together puffs and avoid holes,
focusing on where you can sail effectively near your desired
direction rather than sticking to a specific 
straight line course.

On a day with large scattered clouds, the shadows of clouds traveling across
the water correspond to areas of slightly different temperature and
can sometimes be used to predict puffs and lulls.

Periodically check the sky at the horizon in the average direction of the wind.
That's where new weather will come from, including rainstorms that
you should keep an eye out for. When a rainstorm arrives,
it will usually be extremely windy right before it hits, and then
the wind will die within the rain and remain light afterwards.
Large towering clouds are thunderstorms. Day sailors seek to get
off the water before they arrive with their danger of lightning.

In shore areas on the ocean (and great lakes), the wind will reverse
direction during the day between sea breeze and land breeze due to
their relative temperatures.


Enough and Too Much
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a rough guide to windspeeds for 25 degrees C, average humidity,
and dinghies through 30' sailboats.  Cold air is denser and thus more
powerful at the same speed than warm air. Larger and heavier boats
need more wind to accelerate them.

It can be hard to sail with less than 5 kts of wind because it is too
light to move even small boats well. 

5-10 kts is a great windspeed for beginner sailing. 

10-15 kts is where things become interesting for more experienced
sailors; above ten knots in the summer becomes a "must sail" day for
me. With proper preparation, these conditions can be safe even on
someone's first day of a sailing class, but are usually challenging
for beginners in dinghies. The sailing in a keelboat in this range is
ideal for a beginner, but the docking may be challenging.
 
15-20 kts is too much for most beginners in any sailboat, and will
probably be unpleasant even with enough supervision to remain safe.
It can be an enjoyable challenge for intermediate sailors in boats of
all sizes.

Above 20 kts is advanced sailing in a dinghy and the high end of
intermediate in a keelboat. It requires effective handling of all sail
controls (outhaul, cunningham, vang, traveler, jib cars) and reefing
in a keelboat or downsizing the rig in a dinghy. In a dinghy, good
hiking form, weight shifts, and board adjustments are required to make
progress upwind in these conditions and knockdowns are to be expected.

Above 30 kts is challenging to handle in sailboats of all sizes. It
should not be attempted without significant experience, and is
generally not fun.  Large sailboats can survive tropical storm
conditions of 35-60 kts with extreme tactics (and some luck) but their
skippers do everything possible to avoid these situations.

High Wind Risks
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For dinghies, there are several risks in high wind. The boom moves
with great force and can strike the sailor, and the lines are under
high tension and can pinch body parts when caught or burn when running
fast. Depending on the weight and experience of the sailor, they may
be unable to recover from a capsize. It is harder to make progress
upwind, which can make it difficult or impossible to return to shore
(or the desired part of shore on a lake or river).

With enough experience, inland sailing in a dinghy in high wind
primarily caries the risk of damaging or losing the boat. One can
usually swim to shore, but may not be able to recover a boat that has
a critical failure such as losing the rig or cracking the hull. The
sailor being struck and losing consciousness or held underwater is a
risk in any boat and any conditions and is of course a higher risk in
more extreme conditions.

On the ocean (or unswimmably large lakes or rivers) or with other boat
traffic present, dinghy sailors must be much more conservative than
when on protected water. In those cases it is not prudent to push
beyond conditions where one can easily navigate and recover from
capsize as there is less margin for error.

For large keelboats in high wind, the same risks of large forces on
the lines apply. A crash gybe is particularly dangerous as it can
break the gooseneck and leave the boom flying or sweep the cockpit
with the sheet and hit sailors or knock them overboard. A crew
overboard situation on a keelboat is always serious, and in high wind
maneuvering the boat to safely recover the crew is more
difficult. 

However, it isn't generally the wind itself but the waves created that
are dangerous for keelboats in very high wind.  Keelboats are
generally safer from capsize due to wind and less prone to critical
gear failures than dinghies, but can be swamped, rolled, or pitch
poled by large waves. They also lose steerage when severely heeled or
pitched, which can lead to a broach or accidental gybe.


Depowering
===============================================================

An overpowered sailboat is not just hard to control and uncomfortable
to be on. It is also slow. There is no reason to sail overpowered.
When overpowered, there will be too much windward helm upwind. The
boat will heel far over, especially in gusts. (It will also heel too
much if the angle of attack is too steep because the sheet is too
tight; that isn't overpowered, that is just bad trim.)

When overpowered, the easiest control for depowering is to decrease
the angle of attack of the sails. Ease the sheet and intentionally
luff a little. Althought the sail will lose its beautiful curve, you
will have more control and actually move faster.

You can also achieve the same effect when close hauled by *pinching*
and pointing slightly higher than close hauled. The combination of
easing and pinching allows you to navigate gusts and higher winds.

Of course, trimming the sail too tightly also depowers the sail. But
it is generally not a good tactic because it causes excess heel, puts
more strain on all parts of the system (including your arm), and makes
it hard to know how depowered you are.

There are many ways to depower the sail without luffing it using the
advanced sailing controls. I've noted at the start of this guide that
tightening the outhaul, vang, and cunningham can be helpful in high
wind without explaining why. Once you are confident in your use of the
sheets for trim, move on to the
[intermediate guide](intermediate.md.html) to learn how to use more
controls for better sail shape in all conditions.
