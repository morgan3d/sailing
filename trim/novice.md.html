This sail trim guide is for novice sailors in less than 15 knots of wind. 
As a skipper, novice means that you're comfortable sailing
a dinghy or small keelboat on your own as described in the
[10 Easy Steps](../beginner/index.md.html) guide and are familiar with the
[Essential Rope Techniques](../rope/index.md.html). Now, you want to
improve your sail handling beyond intuition for more speed and control.

As crew, novice means that you are comfortable on the boat and engaged
as an active participant, having been briefed by your skipper on
terminology and expectations. That could be as soon as your first day
on a boat, or take a few trips to build the comfort level. For crew,
this guide is good for moving beyond blindly following the skipper's
instructions to have autonomy and understanding in sail adjustment.

If already you've mastered the techniques in this article, then my
[Intermediate Trim](intermediate.md.html) guide may be more appropriate.

There's a lot more to effective sailing than sail handling. Steering,
navigation, ballast management, mooring, rig adjustment, race
strategy, and boat maintenance are all key skills. However, if you're
day sailing in a small boat, or crewing for someone else, then sail
handling is one of the first skills you'll want independent ability
in.

Furthermore, it may be surprising that this article is the equivalent
of 11 pages almost exclusively on how to adjust a mainsheet in
moderate wind. This should underscore how important it is. Optimal
mainsail angle of attack is the base learning for all other sail
trim. It is also the most significant area of potential improvement
for most sailors.


Look at the Sail
====================================================================

*Look at the sail* while sailing. That's how you know when it needs to
be adjusted and learn how it reacts to different conditions. 

*Look at the sail* when adjusting it. Do not look at the control line
or other boats while adjusting a sail. The main feedback all comes
from the sail. This includes while raising a sail with a halyard.

When performance day sailing and racing, I spend about one third of my
time looking at the sail. That's usually looking at the sail for four
seconds and then spending about eight seconds looking at other boats,
the horizon, and water. I occasionally glance around checking on
systems and people in the boat. I only ever look at lines to verify
that they are untangled, cleated or uncleated properly, and not
chafing. I always look at the sail and never at lines while adjusting
them unless they are jammed, or in the special cases described below.

(There are a few exceptions for experienced sailors who are racing.
In a dinghy, those sailors can feel the impact of their adjustments
and will depend more on feel than vision to maintain situational
awareness in close quarters at a start line or mark rounding. 
For very large adjustments, including changing points of sail and
switching to a spinnaker, they will also use marks on the lines help 
them consistently hit their same base trim before making fine
adjustments. By definition, none of this applies to novices, but it is
something to look forward to!)


Sheet Trim
=====================================================================

Angle of Attack
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When sailing with the wind coming from front or mostly beside the
boat, the sail acts as a vertical airfoil. Adjust the sail's *angle of
attack* using the sheet until the sail is about 5 degrees trimmed in
from the barely luffing point. Most new sailors overtrim, especially
when sailing upwind and heeling. Just ease the sail until the luff
point and then bring it back a bit.

When the wind is coming from behind the boat, the sail is a big drag
parachute. Downwind, ease the sheet to catch as much wind as
possible. The jib does very little downwind, which is why more
experienced sailors may fly a spinnaker.

Bits of yarn or ribbon called *tell tales* that are taped to the
sails can help be an early warning system for trim adjustments. They
are taped in both sides of the sail with a slight offset. The *inside
tell tale* is the one that you can see directly, on the windward side
of the sail.  The *outside tell tale* is the one that you can only see
dimmly through the sail, on the leeward side of the sail.

![Tell tales. Green is flying well and red is breaking. The luff is on the right of the image. The green tell tale is on the inside and the red is on the outside (far/leeward side) of the sail). The sheet needs to be eased to make that outside red tell tale fly cleanly as well.](tell-tale.jpg)

These are like flags, so they should stream backwards along the sail
when both sides are receiving correct amounts of wind. If one of them
"breaks" and is not flying straight backwards, then move the sail in
the direction of the broken tell tale to give that side of the sail
more wind. When the wind is light, tell tales may not be reliable.
The yarn ones especially tend to get stuck to the sail.

There are various mneumonics for sail trim, all of which are a bad
idea to fuss with. The tell tales are showing you the wind pressure
directly--just move the sail into it--and the sail luffing lets you
know when something is really wrong.


Grip
--------------------------------------------------------------------

![Proper sheet grip](sheet_grip.jpg width=300)Always hold a sheet like a microphone, with the working end towards
the sail coming out of your fist by your pinkie and the tail end
coming out by your thumb. This lets you use your bicep to do most of
the work (instead of lower back) and gives a large range of motion. It
also avoids the risk of index finger and thumb being caught in a block
or winch.

Try to hold the a sheet with just enough pressure that it does not
slip from your hand. (The same advice applies to a tiller or wheel.)
A tight deathgrip is fatiguing, but also reduces your ability to sense
a change in pressure that is valuable feedback.

Never wrap a sheet around your hand to get more purchase. It can be
hard to release in a dangerous situation, and risks rope burn, and can
pull your hand into a dangerous position or trap you if falling
overboard.

Consider wearing fingerless sailing or biking gloves to reduce chafing 
on your hand and improve grip when wet.

Keep your hand well back from a cleat, winch, or block. Especially
when releasing a cleat, the line can jump forward.

![RS Aero vang cam cleat](cam_cleat.jpg width=300) A *cam cleat* has two rotating jaws that the line is pulled down (or
for some mainsheets, up) between to lock in place. These are
frequently used to reduce the strain and free up a hand for a sailor
on sheets.  When releasing, you must both pull in and up (or down)
from the cleat.  This can be difficult when sitting on the
rail/gunnel. With a little practices, you can learn to flick slack in
the line down so that it releases when it hits the cleat and does not
require leaning in over the cleat.

For more information about winch operation and preparing sheets, see the
[rope skills guide](../rope/index.md.html).


Other Controls
=====================================================================
I discuss more sail controls for shape in the the
[intermediate](intermediate.md.html) sail trim article. These controls are
essential for high performance and stronger wind conditions, but can
be neglected as a novice focusing on the sheets. For a novice level,
reasonable settings and amount of understanding are as follows.

The *cunningham* (mainsail downhaul) adjusts luff (front edge) tension.
Leave it off in light wind and progressively tighten it for stronger
wind to help the boat point higher upwind.
  
The *halyard* also adjusts luff tension, and is used in the absence
of a cunningham. Raise your halyard all of the way on any sails as a
novice.  Be careful to not overtension once the sail is at the top;
you're just straining the part of the line after the top block and
potentially jamming your sail at that point.

The *vang* adjusts leech (back edge) tension and flattens the mainsail
to reduce power in higher wind. Keep it only just tighter than
sagging to prevent the boom from riding up in gusts and provide some
shape upwind, and tighten more upwind in strong conditions. 

The *outhaul* adjusts foot (bottom edge) tension and flattens the mainsail.
In a keelboat, bring it back to the marked line. In a dinghy, seek
about 20cm of space between the mainsail and boom when upwind.
Loosen in light wind and when sailing downwind. Tighten to 10cm in stronger
wind, but do not flatten all of the way or you won't have good acceleration
and control upwind.
  
The *traveler* allows independent control of the angle of attack and
leech tension with the mainsheet. Leave it centered as a novice.
  
*Jib cars* control the leech of the jib upwind. Leave them centered
as a novice, although bring them forward when reefing (which is not
really a novice situation!)
  
*Leech lines* control the leech of the sails and are typically set
just after raising sails. They are also convenient for helping keep
shape in older sails.  Ignore them as a novice and just ensure that
they aren't loose and able to catch in anything.
  
*Stay tension* and *mast rake* are very advanced controls. If your
boat has stays, have someone else adjust these for you once to a
level that is safe for the rig, and then ignore them until you've
mastered the other elements. The exceptions are dinghy forestays
(which in a boat like a 420 is the wire through the jib luff, not
the wire used to retain the mast on shore). In many boats these must
be set every time it is sailed. Refer to the manual and trim guide
for your boat to determine appropriate tension in this case.


If you want to begin experimenting more, start with the traveler as it
is the easiest control to understand. The traveler lets you separate
the downward and inward pull of the mainsheet when sailing
upwind. Adjust it to keep the mainsheet roughly vertical until it goes
beyond the traveler track, at which point the traveler will be
released nearly to the end on that side. Avoid pulling the traveler
past halfway when close hauled.


Changing Tacks
===============================================================

Tacking
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from close hauled on one tack through head to
wind to close hauled on another tack, the sail switches sides after
luffing and the maneuver is called *tacking*. 

Tacking is potentially
difficult to achieve if there is very strong or very light wind, in
which case the boat may not make it through the tack and can become
stuck in irons. It is generally considered safe because the sail
naturally loses power in the middle of the maneuver, so the forces
are minimized and easy to control. 

### Rudder

To avoid being stuck in irons when tacking, tack
decisively and with some speed on. If pinching into strong wind or
while racing, you may even need to turn away from the wind a bit to
accelerate enough to make a clean tack.

Move the rudder significantly, but not all of the way to the stops
because it will add too much drag.  Hold the rudder in place until the
boat is nearly pointed to the new tack, and then ease it back towards
the center. Larger and heavier boats take some time to respond to
rudder inputs both entering and leaving the tack, so anticipate to
avoid overcorrecting on each end.

### Mainsheet

The mainsheet does not need to be adjusted during a typical tack from
close-hauled on one side to the other side, because the trim will be the
same. 

### Jibsheet

The sheet of a self-tacking jib does not need to be adjusted during a
tack.  This is the point of a self-tacking jib.

A traditional jib with separate sheets needs to be brought across. The
new trim will be the same as the previous one, but on the other side.
For a basic tacking maneuver, wait until the jib luffs. Release the
previous working jibsheet, and then pull the jib around as the wind
blows it through and trim in quickly, before it fills with wind and
gets difficult.  In less than 15 knots of wind on any boat less than
40', anyone should be able to get the new working jibsheet mostly
trimmed without using a winch.  Pulling directly without cranking is
much faster and easier. As the jib loads up with wind on the new tack
a winch is then required on most keelboats to finish the trim.

If the jibsheets catch on the mast, do not immediately go forward to
clear them. Leaving the cockpit suddenly can be dangerous, especially
during a maneuver. Instead:

1. Wait a second to see if it blows free by itself.
2. Try flicking one or both sheets to move a hump of slack towards the
   obstruction.
3. Try pulling on the old working sheet to bring the clew back past
   the obstruction and release it.
4. Notify the skipper of the problem. They may choose to turn the
   rudder back instead.
5. If still stuck, discuss the situation with the skipper instead of
   taking action without coordination. They may direct you to go
   forward, or have a safer solution.
   
Clearing a line that is jammed under tension can be dangerous. It
will move suddenly with potentially great force when released,
possibly hitting the person who cleared it or catching and dragging
them. Fingers can get trapped between the line and the obstruction.
Treat these situations with the gravity that they deserve.

### Missing Stays

If the boat loses too much speed during the tack, it will "miss stays"
and end up "in irons," with the sails luffing and no steerage. The
most reliable way to recover in this situation is to backwind the
sails.

Holding the mainsail out on the new side and steering backwards will
help the boat complete the tack. If a headsail is available, it can be
backwinded on the same side it was previously on to help push the bow
around.

On some boats, holding the jib backwinded for a moment on _every_ tack
can help them pull through the tack faster even if they are going to
succeed without it.


### Maintaining Speed

A boat generally loses speed during a tack. The better it tacks, the less speed
lost. Sail handling techniques can improve performance.

Headsails apply their force ahead of the mast and turn the boat off
the wind. The mainsail applies force behind the mast and turns the
boat into the wind. To sail straight, these must be roughly balanced,
with the rudder compensating for the remaining weather helm. To turn
into the wind quickly, ease (but do not luff) headsails and slightly
overtrim the main to intentionally unbalance the sail plan without
creating excess rudder drag. 

Overtrimming the main on a catboat or a boat with headsails will also
increase heel. Except for skiffs, allow the boat to heel for a tack
by bringing crew weight in. This changes the hull shape relative to the
water. The asymmetry causes the boat to head up into the wind faster.
Once through head to wind, keep the boat flat so that the hull isn't
fighting the rotation of now falling off the wind.

On a very broad tack when moving to or point of sail other than
closehauled, continue trimming the sails throughout the tack. This
keeps the lift forces active and reduces the drag forces of a luffing
sail. A sailboat can't turn unless it is also moving forward relative
to the water.

### Roll Tack

Dinghies can *roll tack* by greatly exaggerating the ballast
movement and heeling to maintain speed through a tack:

1. Initiate the tack by creating excess heel. Slightly overtighten
   the main and shift ceew weight leeward, probably to the center 
   of the boat as it will already want to heel without crew hiking. 
   Bury the leeward gunnel in the water. 
2. Remain/return to the original windward side until the boat has
   passed head to wind so that the heel angle pulls the luffing
   boom down over the crew's heads (whose seats may get wet).
3. Stand up and quickly cross the nearly vertical cockpit to the the new 
   windward rail and hike hard. This will rapidly bringing the mast
   up through the air and fill the sail. Do not create windward
   heel; the goal is to flatten the boat and the mast should never
   move beyond vertical.
   
If done correctly, the boat will exit the tack with the same speed
that it entered. It is possible to exit _faster_ than entering because
that final roll can accelerate the boat with the strong apparent wind
from the mast rising. Leaving a tack or gybe faster than it was entered
in a race is illegal under rule 42.

![Roll tack in a 420.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAmQW6mahvs)

![Roll tack in a Laser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQbf-1fyDH8)

For lightweight boats with relatively flat hulls, roll tacking loses
its advantages in stronger wind. When racing, I generally don't roll
tack a Laser above 10 kts of wind. Keeping on a plane right into the tack and
maintaining good control is more important than that burst of
apparent wind. In an RS Aero I don't roll above 5 kts, and in a skiff
one never rolls.


Gybing
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the boat passes from running on one tack to running on the other
tack, that is called a *gybe* (also spelled "jibe"). The sail never
luffs in this case. It is powered on one side and then suddenly
powered on the other side. 

Gybing is easy to accomplish because there is never any loss of
power. In fact, it is too easy. It is potentially dangerous because
there is never a natural reduction of force and the sail and boom can
come across the boat very fast and when the crew is unprepared.

To maintain control during a gybe, bring the mainsail into the center
of the boat just before turning the rudder. Then, ease it back out on
the new side, rather than letting it crash on its own. In light wind,
you can instead grab the mainsheet directly on the way to the boom and
move it from one side to the other to force the sail to gybe. When
gybing, the boat generally maintains speed.

Avoid a surprising crash gybe through vigilance when sailing downwind.
Attend to incoming changes of wind direction and continuously watch
the back edge of the sail to see if it is curling and about to move.
In very strong and changeable winds, avoid sailing directly downwind
entirely.

### Roll Gybe
![Roll gybe in a Laser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASFoEvmKWPU)

Dinghies can roll gybe, using similar tactics for the roll tack. The
critical issue on the gybe is to ensure that the boom does not hit the
water when it crosses, which can broach the boat.


### Fearless Gybes

There is no need to be afraid of gybing. Control the main and only
sail in conditions that you can handle. Bring the main across
intentionally by throwing it in light wind and centering it in heavy
wind. The forces will never be overstrong and you will always have
control of the boat.

_Accidental_ gybes on large keelboats are prevented with boom brakes
or preventers, and on smaller keelboats and dinghies with vigilance.
Most boats sail slowly dead downwind and will spend most of their
downwind time on deep reaches instead of directly running, in the case
where gybes might occur. On a small boat, if you're looking at the
incoming wind on the water and at the sail, and attending to the feel
of the boat and the helm, then an accidental gybe is unlikely.

In a small boat, if the conditions make you afraid to gybe then you
should return to shore. The maneuver should never be uncontrolled and
thus hard and dangerous. If it isn't safe to gybe, then it isn't safe
to sail. 

If you're concerned about gybing in a large boat, that is one sign that
you need to reduced sail by reefing. Only in storm conditions with
exceptional wind and strong waves should it be necessary to fall back
on a "chicken gybe" by tacking around 270 degrees instead of gybing.

Moreover, I've sailed many boats that are hard to tack in very high or
very low wind. I _prefer_ gybing to tacking in a dinhgy in wind over
25 kts. It is a way to maintain speed and control of the turn and
avoid getting stuck in irons. While we rightly fear a strike from the
boom during a gybe, in high wind a controlled boom during gybe may be
safer than an uncontrolled boom swinging wildly in wind and waves
when stuck in irons during a failed tack.

I also often gybe dinghies in moderate to high wind to reverse
direction during the starting sequence of a race in situations where
others might tack. Early in the sequence, gybing can be better for
switching from starboard to port tack while reaching. It allows
changing direction without changing speed and once on port tack I
usually want to come back parallel to the line further downwind from
the starboard reaching boats anyway. 

At the very end of the race start sequence,
a gybe can also be valuable for getting above a windward boat when a
last-minute wind shift suddenly makes starting on port tack
advantageous. In that situation, the leeward boat can't _tack_ onto
port because they'd lose rights over the windward boat as soon as they
pass head to wind, and they also have a hard time getting in front to
tack cleanly because they are in its lee.  The gybe may instead let
them maintain speed, turn without a collision, and emerge into clear
air on the preferred tack at the line without reducing speed or
steering control in the middle of the maneuver by backwinding.

Wind
====================================================================

True Wind
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The wind in the absence of a boat is the *true wind*, as distinguished
by the apparent wind that the boat perceives in its own reference frame.

Wind is described by the direction it comes _from_. An East wind blows
from East to West. If it is a due East wind, then facing at 90 degrees
on a compass is facing into the wind.

Wind speed is measured in knots, abbreviated kt or kts. 1 knot is one
nautical mile per hour, where a nautical mile is one degree of
latitude. That's about 1/24000 the circumference of the Earth.

10 kts is about 11.5 mph and 18.5 kph. So, the speed in knots is
slightly higher than in mph and a little less than double the speed in
kph. This is important to know because your forecast may be in
different units.

The power of wind rises with the cube of wind speed. For example, the
difference between 5 and 10 kts is about the same as the difference
between 20 and 21 kts. This means that the exact wind speed is more
important to attend to in strong conditions.

Apparent Wind
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A moving boat experiences *apparent wind*. Because the boat is moving,
the wind always seems to be coming from a direction slightly more
rotated towards the boat's own course. When sailing upwind, this makes
the wind seem stronger, and when sailing downwind it makes it seem
weaker.  The presence of headsails also redirects the wind experienced
by the mainsail.

There are two important and common implications of apparent wind.
First, as a boat accelerates upwind or on a reach, the sails must be
adjusted (by trimming them in) to account for the new relative
direction of the wind. Second, it is easy to underestimate the wind
strength when sailing downwind. Sailors must be aware of this in 
moderate to high wind to stay within a safe and controllable margin
downwind, and also to avoid being surprised when later turning upwind.
  
There are also some interesting uncommon implications for very high
performance boats such as racing catmarans and foilers. These include
limitations on downwind sailing speed and effectively sailing upwind
when on a deep reach relative to the true wind.


Variation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wind is not constant. It changes direction and strength continuously
throughout the day in predictable ways, and *shifts* on a scale of
every few minutes in many areas in unpredictable ways. If there are
large landforms or buildings--or other boats--nearby, they will also
block or redirect wind. 

Wind is created by temperature and pressure differences. Near the
surface it is slowed by land features such as trees and hills, and
funneled to greater strength by large features such as rows of
buildings and mountain passes. Over large flat farmland or meadows,
and large bodies of water, it proceeds unimpeded and can build to
greater strength.

Good sailors always look at a forecast before sailing to know the
approximate conditions and _general way that they will change while sailing_. Then,
while sailing, they continuously attend to wind strength, direction,
and incoming weather visible in the sky.  

You can tell which way the wind is blowing by looking at flags, loose
hair, windvanes, and trees. If you are ever very confused, simply ease
your mainsheet and the front of the boom will point into the
wind. Many boats have a wind indicator (windvane) on the top of the
mast, or pieces of yarn tied to the stays to help visualize the local
wind direction.

Look for signs of small changes in the wind strength and
direction. [You can see these](https://www.sailingworld.com/story/racing/how-to-see-wind-on-water-when-sailing/) by watching the movement of dark patches
on the surface of the water, as well as by watching other
sailboats. The patches are easier to notice when wearing polarized
sunglasses that cut the glare. If there is a large glassy patch of
water, that is smooth and has little wind. If sailing near buildings
or cliffs, beware of ways that wind may bend significantly near them.

A *gust* of wind is a sudden, short-lived increase in wind strength.
It often comes from a different direction than the average wind.
A *puff* is a small gust, shorter and weaker. A *lull* is a time
where the wind is reduced. A *hole* is the area where the lull
is occuring. To sail fast, link together puffs and avoid holes,
focusing on where you can sail effectively near your desired
direction rather than sticking to a specific 
straight line course.

On a day with large scattered clouds, the shadows of clouds traveling across
the water correspond to areas of slightly different temperature and
can sometimes be used to predict puffs and lulls.

Periodically check the sky at the horizon in the average direction of
the wind. That's where new weather will come from, including
rainstorms that you should keep an eye out for. When a rainstorm
arrives, it will usually be extremely windy right before it hits, and
then the wind will die within the rain and remain light afterwards.
Large towering clouds are thunderstorms. Day sailors seek to get off
the water before storms arrive and create the danger of lightning.

In shore areas on the ocean (and great lakes), the wind will reverse
direction during the day between sea breeze and land breeze due to
their relative temperatures.


Enough and Too Much
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

![Examples and commentary of various inland wind conditions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N21wAFdVoAE)

Here's a rough guide to the implications of various steady windspeeds
for 25 degrees C air, average humidity, on bay or inland waters for
sailboats under 35', and in moderate current and low traffic
situations. Those details are important because changes to them can
affect how much wind a boat and crew can handle.  Cold air is denser
and thus more powerful at the same speed than warm air. Larger and
heavier boats need more wind to accelerate them. Areas with
unprotected ocean sailing, strong current, heavy marine traffic, and
cold water require more caution than described here because of their
inherent risks. The nature of the wind greatly affects navigation: is
it steady, gusting from the same direction, variable and gusting from
multiple directions, or blowing with or against the current?  So, what
is reasonable at 15 kts of wind on one body of water and boat may only
be appropriate for 7 kts in another situation.

Less than 5 kts of wind can be hard to sail in because it is too
light to move even small boats well. 

5-10 kts is a great windspeed range for beginner sailing. 

10-15 kts is where things become interesting for more experienced
sailors. In particular, this is the range where full sails can be used
without being overpowered, so most boats are sailing at their best. It
is also planing wind for most dinghies and single hull wind for racing
catamarans. 

Above ten knots in the summer becomes a "must sail" day for most of my
sailing friends. With preparation, these conditions can be safe even
on someone's first day of a sailing class, but are usually challenging
for beginners in dinghies. The sailing in a keelboat in this range is
ideal for a beginner, but the docking may be challenging for a beginner
or novice skipper.

As a novice at sail trim, 10-15 kts is the highest range that you
should be concerned with and expect to be comfortable within.  For
context and to suggest some goals for your development as a sailor,
I'll describe some higher ranges.

15-20 kts is too much for most beginners in any sailboat. It will be
at best unpleasant even with enough supervision for them to otherwise
remain safe. This range can be an enjoyable challenge for intermediate
sailors in boats of all sizes, and I'd certainly rather race in 15 kts
than 10 kts of wind. The vang and cunningham are key controls one
needs to operate in this range, and controlling tacks and gybes
becomes critical because the forces involved even on a dinghy are
substantial.

Above 20 kts is advanced sailing in a dinghy and the high end of
intermediate in a keelboat. It requires effective handling of all sail
controls (outhaul, cunningham, vang, traveler, halyard tension, jib
cars), as well as reefing in a keelboat or downsizing the rig in a
dinghy. In a dinghy, good hiking form, weight shifts, and board
adjustments are also required to make progress upwind in these
conditions and knockdowns are to be expected. In a keelboat steering
becomes a key skill in these high wind situations. Note that in this
windspeed range the focus has moved from trying solely trying to
maximize speed to instead trying to maintain effective control while
overpowered.

30-35 kts is challenging to handle in sailboats of all sizes. It
should not be attempted without significant experience. This is
somewhat misleadingly referred to as "survival conditions" in most
sail trim guides and boat manuals. However, for an expert sailor with
a reasonable boat, I'd consider it more of a misery condition than a
survival one unless in large waves or on a lee shore. I've voluntarily
sailed in these conditions only when they grew slightly beyond what
I anticipated for the day or when on a deadline.

Above 35 kts enters the tropical storm category. Keelboats can
survive conditions of 35-60 kts with
[extreme tactics](https://amzn.to/3J01arM) (and some luck) but their
skippers do everything possible to avoid these situations. This is well
beyond day sailing and something that one handles on a blue water passage
when there is no other option. I've only involuntarily sailed in these
conditions, when caught by storms. For myself, this is the range that 
I want to be prepared to sail in but hopefully almost never encounter.


High Wind Risks
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For dinghies, there are several risks in high wind. The boom moves
with great force and can strike the sailor, and the lines are under
high tension and can pinch body parts when caught, or cause rope burns when running
fast. Depending on the weight and experience of the sailor, they may
be unable to recover from a capsize. It is harder to make progress
upwind, which can make it difficult or impossible to return to shore
(or the desired part of shore on a lake or river).

With enough experience, inland sailing in a dinghy in high wind
primarily caries the risk of damaging or losing the boat. One can
usually swim to shore, but may not be able to recover a boat that has
a critical failure such as losing the rig or cracking the hull. The
sailor being struck and losing consciousness or held underwater is a
risk in any boat and any conditions and is of course a higher risk in
more extreme conditions.

On the ocean (or unswimmably large lakes or rivers) or with other boat
traffic present, dinghy sailors must be much more conservative than
when on protected water. In those cases it is not prudent to push
beyond conditions where one can easily navigate and recover from
capsize as there is less margin for error.

For large keelboats in high wind, the same risks of large forces on
the lines apply. A crash gybe is particularly dangerous as it can
break the gooseneck and leave the boom flying or sweep the cockpit
with the sheet and hit sailors or knock them overboard. A crew
overboard situation on a keelboat is always serious, and in high wind
maneuvering the boat to safely recover the crew is more
difficult. 

However, it isn't generally the wind itself but the waves created that
are dangerous for keelboats in very high wind.  Keelboats are
generally safer from capsize due to wind and less prone to critical
gear failures than dinghies, but can be swamped, rolled, or pitch
poled by large waves. They also lose steerage when severely heeled or
pitched, which can lead to a broach or accidental gybe.


Depowering
===============================================================

An overpowered sailboat is not just hard to control and uncomfortable
to be on. It is also slow. There is no reason to sail overpowered.
When overpowered, there will be too much windward helm upwind. The
boat will heel far over, especially in gusts. (It will also heel too
much if the angle of attack is too steep because the sheet is too
tight; that isn't overpowered, that is just bad trim.)

When overpowered, the easiest control for depowering is to decrease
the angle of attack of the sails. Ease the sheet and intentionally
luff a little. Although the sail will lose its beautiful curve, you
will have more control and actually move faster.

You can also achieve the same effect when close hauled by *pinching*
and pointing slightly higher than close hauled. The combination of
easing and pinching allows you to navigate gusts and higher winds.

Of course, trimming the sail too tightly also depowers the sail. But
it is generally not a good tactic because it causes excess heel, puts
more strain on all parts of the system (including your arm), and makes
it hard to know how depowered you are.

There are many ways to depower the sail without luffing it using the
advanced sailing controls. I've noted at the start of this guide that
tightening the outhaul, vang, and cunningham can be helpful in high
wind without explaining why. Once you are confident in your use of the
sheets for trim, move on to the
[intermediate guide](intermediate.md.html) to learn how to use more
controls for better sail shape in all conditions.
