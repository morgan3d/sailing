                   **Recreational Vessel Marine VHF Guide**
               Published 2022-12-05; Last updated 2025-09-01

Boats communicate by VHF radio on marine channels, at either
1 W power locally or 25 W for maximum range. It has an
effective range at 25 W of
[5-20 NM](https://www.offshoreblue.com/comms/vhf-capabilities.php)
(around 10-35 km) for unobstructed line of line of sight between
antennas mounted high on masts. Marine VHF use includes recreational,
commercial, and military use, so it allows boats and land stations
from different categories to coordinate safely.

Not covered in this article, boats _also_ communicate by cellular
phone (when in range of land antennas), satellite phone, satellite
internet, marine SSB/UHF radio, and ham radio, as well as employing
various emergency transmitters.

with a VHF radio can hear everyone's transmissions in range, and only
one station can broadcast at a time. Channels and protocols are
therefore tightly regulated. Their proper use must be observed for
effective and legal use of this critical safety and communication
resource.

That said, there is significant local variation in practice based
on which situations are more common in a given region. Listen in
to experienced operators such as Coast Guard, commercial fishers,
harbor masters, and commercial traffic to understand the local
practice.

_This article is a reference guide for marine VHF use. It is not
authoritative on protocols or intended as a sole safety guide, and may
have errors or omissions. You have sole responsibility for verifying
information here and I assume no liability and provide no
warranty. Check your local laws for licensing requirements and
additional regulations. Note that even turning on a marine VHF for
passive listening without a license is illegal in some jurisdictions._


Controlling Station
=============================================================================
A *station* is a specific radio, which can be installed on a boat,
carried as handheld by a person, or installed on shore.

The receiver of a call is the *controlling* station, except for distress
(mayday) calls, where the vessel in distress is the controlling station.


Emergency Transmissions
=============================================================================
The *priority* of transmissions is Distress overrides Urgency
overrides Safety overrides Routine.

An emergency transmission sequence begins with a voice *call* and is
followed by a voice *message*. These are often combined into a single 
transmission.

A DSC *alert* may also be issued before the voice call. 

Each voice transmission begins with a *signal*, such as "Mayday".

Safety (Sécurité)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety messages are typically sent by the Coast Guard or large ships,
as well as by any vessel entering a narrow or restricted visibility 
pass such as those in Vancouver Island's gulf islands.

Broadcast the call on channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité
All stations, all stations, all stations (or rarely, a specific station)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude),  (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

I will broadcast a navigation warning about (summary) on channel (working channel) (or include here if short).

out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Then, broadcast the message on the working channel, such as 06:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité
All stations, all stations, all stations (or rarely, a specific station)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the navigation hazard)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The message can be combined with the call in a single transmission
when short:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sécurité, sécurité, sécurité
All stations, all stations, all stations
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)

I am a (length) (type) vessel entering (narrow pass)
traversing (direction).

out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


It is unusual to send a DSC alert for a safety
message. That is only done when a large area is affected.



\newpage
Urgency (Pan-Pan)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(_Pronounced "pahn-pahn"_)

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pan-pan, pan-pan, pan-pan
All stations, all stations, all stations
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)

My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the urgency)

I have (n) persons aboard

(relevant identifying details for the boat, course and speed, etc.)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Continue monitoring for three minutes after _receiving_ an urgency call.


\newpage
Distress (Mayday)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayday, mayday, mayday
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)


Mayday
My position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(nature of the distress)

(the assistance that is required)

I have (n) persons aboard 
(Are they wearing PFDs? Are any children? Is anyone injured or in the water?)

(relevant identifying details for the boat, such as length and color)

(course and speed)

over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every following message sent by the vessel in distress 
should begin with `Mayday (vessel)`.


Respond to a mayday call with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayday 
(distressed vessel), (distressed vessel), (distressed vessel)
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)

Received mayday

...

Over
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If other traffic is not respecting the mayday and still transmitting,
the controlling station can explicitly impose silence on everyone with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
(offending transmitter)
This is (vessel)

Silence Mayday ("Seelonce mayday")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If other traffic is not respecting the mayday and still transmitting,
a _third party station_ not in distress or involved in the rescue
can explicitly impose silence with the following. Because different
transmitters have different power and are in different locations,
it is possible that the offending transmitter can't hear the mayday
in progress that you can hear. This lets them know that you need clear
airwaves to stand by and monitor the situation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
(offending transmitter)
This is (vessel)

Silence distress ("Seelonce distress")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


End a mayday with:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ none
Mayday (vessel)

Silence fini ("Seelonce feenee")

Out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


\newpage
Distress Relay (Mayday Relay)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On channel 16:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayday relay, mayday relay, mayday relay
All stations, all stations, all stations
This is (vessel), (vessel), (vessel)
Call sign (call sign)
MMSI number (number)


Mayday received from (vessel) at (time/date):
Their position is (latitude), (longitude), (+ location relative to some landmark)

(the nature of their distress)
(the assistance that is required)

They have (n) persons aboard
(describe the people--wearing PFDs? children? injured or in the water?)

(relevant identifying details for the boat, course and speed, etc.)

US, UK, and Canada Licensing
=============================================================================

Operating a VHF radio in Canadian waters requires a
[Restricted Operator Certificate-Maritime (ROC-M)](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/015.nsf/eng/h_00005.html),
which is issued by
[Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons](https://www.cps-ecp.ca/).
Operating includes even just turning the radio on. The ROC-M is
restricted to operation on water for non-commercial vessels.

A boater visiting Canada for less than 45 days from the US [does
not require](https://tc.canada.ca/en/marine-transportation/preparing-operate-your-vessel/visitor-information) a VHF 
ROC-M if they hold the equivalent US [RROP](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/commercial-radio-operator-license-program/commercial-0).

In Canada, a VHF station license is _not_ required for a radio mounted in a
vessel. [It is required for a Canadian vessel in US waters](https://www.sailing.ca/rocm/#). That 
station license is issued by
[Innovation Canada](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/learn-more/key-documents/forms/ic-3020-application-maritime-mobile-radio-station-licence).

Operating a VHF radio in US waters for a US recreational vessel
does not require a license.

Without a land station license, it is illegal in most countries to
transmit on VHF from land. Marine stations may only use marine
channels.

The UK
[requires a maritime license](https://www.rya.org.uk/knowledge/regulations/licensing-onboard-electronics)
to operate VHF, as well as a license for the vessel's radio.

The channels used vary by country.

Marine/aviation VHF cannot be used on land, including to communicate
with a ship, by recreational users. Instead, use FRS or GMRS
UHF ("walkie-talkie") two-way radios. In Canada, approved FRS/GMRS 
devices may be used
[without a license](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/consumer-information/low-power-licence-exempt-radiocommunication-devices-frequently-asked-questions#D2).
In the US, FRS does not require a license but [GMRS does](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs).
Note that in the US, using "voice scrambling/encryption" FRS/GMRS [is illegal](https://apps.fcc.gov/kdb/GetAttachment.html?id=biZxuanIfZOUqdjvLHdsyw%3D%3D&desc=888861%20D01%20Part%2095%20GMRS%20FRS%20v01&tracking_number=239603).


Emergency Implications
======================================================================

Distress
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A distress call (Mayday) is only for an imminent threat to life, not
property. A fire, an uncontrollable hull leak, an injury requiring
immediate hospitalization (including hypothermia), or a crew overboard
at sea are canonical distress scenarios. 

At sea, although everyone might be OK in the aftermath of a storm that
caused the damage, an unrecoverable dismasting, loss of a keel, or
complete destruction of steering capability are distress
scenarios. Any of those would lead to an immediate threat to life if
seas rise or there becomes risk of a collision.

Running out of fuel, running aground in calm conditions, loss of
navigation instruments, or taking on water in a controlled leak are
not distress scenarios if they are not also accompanied by a threat to
life. However, they could transition into distress scenarios and may
merit an urgency or all-stations transmission.

When making a distress call or activating an EPIRB, be prepared to
abandon ship and scuttle or otherwise completely lose your vessel
during a rescue. That criteria helps make clear when you are in an
Urgency (Pan-Pan) versus Distress (Mayday) scenario.


Towing and Salvage
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Accepting a tow or other assistance or leaving a grounded boat are
legally fraught situations. The boat in need of assistance may be in a situation to
be [claimed as salvage](https://www.offshorerisk.com/en/knowledge-base/understanding-the-difference-between-towing-and-salvage/)
by the person who assists. That can include costs up to the value
of the boat and cargo, for what might be perceived by an unaware skipper
as a [simple tow](https://www.practical-sailor.com/belowdecks-amenities/tow-or-salvage) or 
other help. 

The mandatory criteria for salvage are marine *peril*, service
*voluntarily* rendered, and success in saving *persons or
property*. There is substantial gray area around the threshold for
each of these, and incautious phrasing in requesting assistance
can later be interepreted in a courtroom in ways to support them.

I've heard theories about the salvage determination hinging on whose
tow rope is used or other small details. As far as I know, this has no
modern legal basis and that the above critera are all that matters.

Even absent a salvage claim, there is little recourse after the fact
for an unexpectedly high towing or fuel bill. This is much the same as
with a tow truck call on land. A wise skipper would know the relevant
laws, attempt to have a signed document before accepting assistance,
and avoid accepting assistance unless absolutely necessary.
